Parliament Does Not Support Amendment Fre@@ eing T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko
Today , the Ukraine parliament dismissed , within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment , the motion to revo@@ ke an article based on which the opposition leader , Y@@ u@@ lia T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko , was sentenced .
The amendment that would lead to free@@ ing the imprisoned former Prime Minister was revo@@ ked during second reading of the proposal for mitig@@ ation of sentences for economic offences .
In October , T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvanta@@ geous gas deal with Russia .
The verdict is not yet final ; the court will hear T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko &apos;s appeal in December .
T@@ y@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko claims the verdict is a political reven@@ ge of the regime ; in the West , the trial has also evo@@ ked suspicion of being biased .
The proposal to remove Article 3@@ 65 from the Code of Criminal Procedure , upon which the former Prime Minister was sentenced , was supported by 147 members of parliament .
Its ratification would require 2@@ 26 votes .
Libya &apos;s Vic@@ tory
The story of Libya &apos;s liber@@ ation , or rebel@@ lion , already has its defe@@ ated .
Mu@@ am@@ mar K@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i is bu@@ ried at an unknown place in the deser@@ t . Without him , the war is over .
It is time to define the winners .
As a rule , Isla@@ mis@@ ts win in the country ; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .
The transitional cabinet declared itself a follow@@ er of the customary Sharia law , of which we have already heard .
Libya will become a crime free country , as the punishment for ste@@ aling is having one &apos;s hand ampu@@ tated .
Women can forget about emanci@@ pation ; potential religious rene@@ g@@ ades will be executed ; etc .
Instead of a dictator , a society consisting of competing tri@@ bes will be united by Kor@@ an .
Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
However , our lif@@ est@@ yle is neither unique nor the best one and would not , most probably , be suitable for , for example , the people of Libya .
In fact , it is a wonder that the Islamic fighters accepted help from the non@@ belie@@ vers .
Their only excuse is that from their point of view , NATO ra@@ ids were not controlled by an American general , but Al@@ lah , the great@@ ness of whom they celebra@@ ted with each strike .
When winners are sought for in Libya , the West is not on the list .
We participated in a sho@@ o@@ ting , served Islam , and our politicians got rid of a dictator , their political ally , without any guarantee of profit .
Given the recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq , we decided against military occupation of Libya .
The loc@@ als thus do not have to worry about expe@@ lling of the &quot; crus@@ ad@@ ers . &quot;
Without the occupation , will the oil companies get Libya &apos;s black go@@ ld for next to nothing , though ?
It is quite likely that they will not . The West will then finally be able to bo@@ ast about its sel@@ f@@ less protection of human rights .
Unless the follow@@ ers of the Sharia law put a stop to that .
New Era of Cri@@ sis Com@@ men@@ ces
France and the rest of Europe are now in the investors &quot; spo@@ t@@ light .
A statistical stor@@ m ble@@ w over Europe on Tuesday .
In@@ divi@@ dual countries released their 3@@ Q GDP data .
Be@@ tween quarters , the Czech economy sta@@ gna@@ ted ; Germany and France are growing .
Yet the deb@@ it market is breaking records today .
Invest@@ ors are no longer looking at only Italy ; they now focus on Spain , France , Austria , and others .
Euro@@ zone statistical offices in Germany , Czech Republic , and some other countries , released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter .
Germany &apos;s GDP has grown by the expected 0.5 % ; and France &apos;s by 0.@@ 4 % .
Both countries also adjusted their second quarter data , where Germany did better than expected ( a 0.@@ 3 % increase instead of the original 0.@@ 1 % ) . France reported a slight decrease , by 0.@@ 1 % ( the original information suggested stagnation ) .
In this year &apos;s third quarter , the Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % .
Be@@ tween the quarters though , the GDP sta@@ gna@@ ted . According to the Czech Sta@@ tis@@ tical Office , this confirmed the trend of a gradual s@@ lowing of economic growth .
The results are worse than estimates by analy@@ sts .
K@@ ey events :
In this year &apos;s third quarter , Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % ; however , it sta@@ gna@@ ted between the quarters .
B@@ ased on preliminary and seas@@ onal data , in the third quarter , the German economy gre@@ w by 0.5 % .
Be@@ tween July and September , the economy of both the Euro@@ zone and the European Union gre@@ w , compared to the previous quarter , by 0.@@ 2 % , which corresponds with estimates by analy@@ sts .
The Greek economy showed an interim decrease of 5.@@ 2 % .
The ear@@ nings on its 10@@ -year bonds are 2@@ 8.@@ 45 % .
Ear@@ nings of both Italian and Spanish bonds are growing towards critical limits .
Even Austria , Netherlands , France , and Belgium , etc. are beginning to experience problems .
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is getting worse , ear@@ nings of Czech 1 - year bonds stay under 4 % .
Vo@@ ices are coming from Germany , suggesting that ECB be the last resort credi@@ tor .
Cze@@ ch@@ s qualified for EUR@@ O .
In Montenegro they won 1 : 0 and celebrate a 200 million win@@ d@@ fall .
Fo@@ ot@@ ball representation successfully managed the tou@@ gh@@ est task of the seas@@ on !
Thanks to both the great Č@@ e@@ ch and beautiful goal of P@@ et@@ r J@@ ir@@ á@@ č@@ ek , they won 1 : 0 .
In the second half , Czech football was lu@@ ck@@ y to maintain its lux@@ ury lead from the home return match , and will again feature at the European Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship .
I@@ H@@ N@@ ED@@ .@@ c@@ z wat@@ ched the progress match in a detailed report .
Ne@@ arly no exci@@ tement in the first half , and a great por@@ tion of luck in the other .
Czech representation team , partially due to the home team &apos;s failure in the close ; the great Č@@ e@@ ch ; and hero@@ ic J@@ ir@@ á@@ č@@ ek ; won 1 : 0 in Montenegro , and celebra@@ tes moving on to the European Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship .
Per@@ fe@@ ct Czech team defence only allowed the Montenegro team to threaten in the second half .
D@@ am@@ jan@@ o@@ vic and V@@ uc@@ ini@@ c became the match &apos;s least lu@@ ck@@ y couple after losing two great opportunities .
The wonderful P@@ et@@ r Č@@ e@@ ch is one of the reasons the Czech representation team will not miss the next year &apos;s European Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship . And Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech Cro@@ w@@ ns .
From the opening minutes , the game was very pu@@ gna@@ cious .
Both teams found it difficult to join in the combination ; the game remained around the mid-@@ field line most of the time .
That was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half . L@@ ong k@@ ic@@ ks behind the defence were ne@@ at@@ ly aver@@ ted by the Czech defence .
Iranian Stu@@ dents Are Pre@@ pared to Di@@ e for Their Country &apos;s Nuclear Progra@@ m
They created a live shi@@ el@@ d .
Several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in Iran .
The gesture is to express their support of their country &apos;s nuclear progra@@ m against a possible Israel attack .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; pra@@ yers in front of the building were followed by their chan@@ ting of death to both the USA and Israel .
In Is@@ fa@@ han , Iran , several hundred university students created a live chain around Is@@ fa@@ han U@@ ran@@ i@@ um Con@@ version Fa@@ cili@@ ty .
This way , they express their readiness to protect their country &apos;s nuclear progra@@ m with their own lives .
In its recent report , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( I@@ A@@ EA ) stated that everything leads to the conclusion that Iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon .
Pos@@ sible attack on Iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in Israel .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; pra@@ yers in front of the entran@@ ce into Is@@ fa@@ han U@@ ran@@ i@@ um Con@@ version Fa@@ cili@@ ty were followed by their chan@@ ting of death to both the USA and Israel .
In case of an attack , aimed at the highest possible paraly@@ sation of the Iranian nuclear progra@@ m , the targets would be , based on Israel press , the facilities in both Is@@ fa@@ han and Na@@ tan@@ z , where the uranium is being enrich@@ ed .
An Ob@@ ese Child &apos;s Di@@ et : No break@@ fast and s@@ aus@@ age for din@@ ner
Over a third of children between 9 and 13 are over@@ weight ; while 9 % of school@@ children are over@@ weight , 5 % are ob@@ ese .
As a recent research shows , ob@@ ese children usually come from families with un@@ healthy lif@@ est@@ yle .
Again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .
For example , s@@ aus@@ ages occur up to half more frequently on the tables of ob@@ ese children compared to the families of children with standard weight .
Over 19 % of ob@@ ese children had fri@@ ed chi@@ ps for din@@ ner the day before the research connected to the educational event called O@@ be@@ sity is No Ac@@ cident .
Moreover , the families of ob@@ ese children do not practise sports . However , this concerns a majority of families of current school@@ children - only 15 % of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week .
The research was performed among 900 children .
The research took place at the end of last year &apos;s school year ; it included almost 900 ele@@ mentary school children from throughout Bo@@ hem@@ ia .
It was the second year of the O@@ be@@ sity is No Ac@@ cident event supported by both V@@ š@@ e@@ obe@@ c@@ n@@ á z@@ dra@@ vo@@ t@@ n@@ í po@@ j@@ i@@ š@@ ť@@ ov@@ na insurance company and Uni@@ lever .
So far , the project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children from 4@@ th to 8@@ th gra@@ des .
Pro@@ per di@@ et and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either over@@ weight or ob@@ ese .
&quot; For example , only half of those inqui@@ red said they have five me@@ als a day , in the break@@ fast-@@ s@@ n@@ ack@@ -@@ l@@ un@@ ch-@@ s@@ n@@ ack@@ -@@ din@@ ner pattern , one of the basic preconditions of correct di@@ et , &quot; one of the results of the research says .
No l@@ unch and s@@ aus@@ age in the evening
Ex@@ perts warn that even relative details are crucial for healthy development ; such as a regular time of family break@@ fast .
In the Czech Republic , only 23 % of school@@ children &apos;s families have break@@ fast together .
In a majority of families , everyone has break@@ fast separately .
The worst disco@@ very was the fact that in one tenth of house@@ holds people do not have break@@ fast at all .
Yet break@@ fast is the core of proper daily di@@ et .
A survey has shown that fri@@ es are consu@@ med more often in the families of ob@@ ese children .
Ne@@ arly everyone - regardless of their weight - drin@@ ks swe@@ et soft drin@@ ks every day ( 70 % ) .
Th@@ ough over 40 % of children do sports regularly , the number dro@@ ps down to less than a half - 15 % - when it comes to their parents .
Com@@ pose your own men@@ u
Another part of the survey allowed selected children ( 20@@ 4 boys and 17@@ 2 girls from 13 schools ) to com@@ pose their own men@@ u based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .
