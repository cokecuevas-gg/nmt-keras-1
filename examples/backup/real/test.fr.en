This is perfectly illustrated by the U@@ K@@ IP nu@@ mb@@ ties banning people with HIV .
You mean Nig@@ el F@@ ar@@ age saying the N@@ H@@ S should not be used to pay for people coming to the UK as health tourists , and saying yes when the inter@@ vie@@ wer specifically asked if , with the aforementioned in mind , people with HIV were included in not being welcome .
You raise a stra@@ w man and then kno@@ ck it down with thin@@ ly ve@@ iled hom@@ opho@@ bia .
Every time I or my family need to use the N@@ H@@ S we have to que@@ ue up behind bi@@ go@@ ts with a sense of enti@@ t@@ lement and chron@@ ic hypo@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ a .
I think the stra@@ w man is yours .
Health tourism as defined by the right wing lo@@ oni@@ es is virtually none existent .
I think it &apos;s called democracy .
So no one would be affected by U@@ K@@ IP &apos;s policies against health tourism so no problem .
Only in U@@ K@@ IP La La L@@ and could Car@@ s@@ well be described as revolu@@ tionary .

You also don &apos;t know anything about my personal circumstances or identity so I would be very careful about trying to eradicate a debate with accusations of hom@@ opho@@ bia .
F@@ ar@@ age &apos;s comment came as quite a shock , but only because it is so rarely addressed .

You will just have to find a way of getting over it .
I &apos;@@ m not entirely sure what you &apos;@@ re trying to say , but my gu@@ ess is that you dis@@ like the media reporting things you disagree with .
It is so rarely addressed because unlike F@@ ar@@ ar@@ ge and his Tha@@ t@@ ch@@ eri@@ te lo@@ ony dis@@ ci@@ ples who think aids and floods are a signal from the div@@ ine and not a reflection on their own ignorance in understanding the comple@@ xi@@ ties of humanity as something to celebrate , then no .
In the end the situation is just as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain .
With the new crisis coming , the period of auster@@ ity will not have fixed anything .
H@@ op@@ ing for almost 5 % growth in 2015 is a real jo@@ ke .
Ireland , the &quot; EURO@@ P@@ E@@ AN T@@ IG@@ ER &quot; they used to speak highly of to us years ago .
We know the rest !
It is starting again when you read this article .
They &apos;@@ re trying to pretend that Ireland is a virtu@@ ous country and that a &quot; NE@@ W ECO@@ N@@ OM@@ IC MI@@ R@@ AC@@ LE &quot; is happening .
With the agreement of Brussels , the lowest taxes on companies in Europe , a very flexible labor market , continuing emi@@ gration .
With these ingredients , there is nothing to &quot; cro@@ w about &quot; for the time being with the arrival of the Po@@ les .
In the 8@@ 0s in the twentieth century , Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union , along with Portugal . Consid@@ ering a constant per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , without the new countries , the situation is still better than it ever was .
Greece was ahead .
It is clear that their development was not a long quiet river , given the recent events .
The lowest taxes in Europe ?
That is not correct !
Latvia has a 0 % tax rate for companies .
Now there is real hypocrisy in France from politicians on the taxes that multinationals really pay .
If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009 , they generally pay less than 5 % in France .
Only SMEs pay the full lot .
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again , and there are new ( and expensive ) cars on every street corner , exactly like before the 2008 crisis .
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years , the recovery is evident in the daily traffic j@@ ams from when the schools go back .
This is business news ?

Any article about R@@ y@@ an@@ air attr@@ acts dozens of comments from people who would never fly R@@ y@@ an@@ air , to those who like flying R@@ y@@ an@@ air and think anyone paying anything more than the basic fare has only themselves to blame , etc .
It &apos;s pretty transparent .
R@@ y@@ an@@ air are not going to be happy about the extra cost involved in this incident .
I wonder how long the delays will be and will compensation to passengers by due and if so , can R@@ y@@ an@@ air then get out of paying as they can say it was the airport air traffic control@@ lers error .

Last Sunday in Paris , rue des Fran@@ c@@ s-@@ Bour@@ geo@@ is : le Mar@@ ais is largely pedestri@@ ani@@ zed , and is literally sw@@ arming with people .
The people have not come en masse for the quality of the restaur@@ ants ( ordinary , for the most part ) or for the Journal fair at the Es@@ pace des Blan@@ c@@ s-@@ Man@@ te@@ aux ( hy@@ per@@ -@@ intellectual and slightly out@@ mo@@ ded ) .
The reason for this crow@@ d is that the shops are all open and the area is incredibly lively and ani@@ mated .
With a lot of foreigners who spend ...
Do you think that opening on Sun@@ days is going to create jobs ?
G@@ o to Paris R@@ ue des Fran@@ cs Bour@@ geo@@ is where the shops are open on Sunday , full of people with 50 % tourists .
@ alo@@ es Fal@@ se !
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is the one of the areas that receive a significant number of foreign tourists and this is nu@@ an@@ ced by the fact that they are buying tax@@ -free .
Tour@@ ist areas lose a considerable amount of sales revenue each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains , where expensive equipment , used on Sunday , makes it possible to lower prices .
Sunday rest is a right that employees , besides exceptions , enjoy .
That &apos;s the reason why it is provided for and regulated by the labor code .
Neither the minis@@ try responsible for the economy , nor , moreover , the one responsible for foreign affairs , have the slightest competence to reform the labor code .
So they should shut up .
What use is the law ?
To satisfy a part of the population and the companies who want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday afternoon , I take my grand@@ children to the municipal lib@@ r@@ ary .
In my T@@ own with 3@@ 0,@@ 000 inhabitants where I live in France , the municipal lib@@ r@@ ary is open 4 days a week but not at the weekend !
That is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working times .

By d@@ int of his magnificent or@@ atory and energy he brought this country together to understand that fighting the fas@@ cis@@ ts was the only way to win .
The people of the U@@ k , and France , and Belgium and ultimately the rest of the world can thank go@@ d , that for those five years , just those five years , Chur@@ ch@@ ill was at the hel@@ m , and no other .
The great@@ ness of Chur@@ ch@@ ill is irrelevant to this debate .
Let his descen@@ dants sell the pain@@ tings on the open market to raise the money for I@@ H@@ T , they might even make a profit .
If the public want any of them on display in a mu@@ seu@@ m , they can raise the money and buy them .
It really is that simple .
But we could use the tax money .

We need several thri@@ ving platforms , to s@@ pur competition and development .
We also have completely different requirements and these cannot be satisfied by any one manufacturer , because they are not compatible .
For myself , I tend to buy Ap@@ ple , because I like the underlying philosophy and appreciate design .
Some people are completely un@@ affected by design , they value features , function@@ ality and price .
There is nothing wrong with that .
Let &apos;s get away from the mentality of seeking &quot; one best platform &quot; .
Is there a &quot; one best car manufacturer &quot; , not really , they are different , yet similar .
I would like to see a thri@@ ving mobile industry , with radically different approaches for different people and markets .
This is healthy and needs to be encouraged .
It is in our collective interest to do so .
I am happy that you found exactly what you where looking for and that it is not an Ap@@ ple product , even though I myself made a different choice .

Or do they just attack gender as described in Le Fi@@ gar@@ o , Min@@ u@@ te or Val@@ eurs Actu@@ elles ?
Are their sources Ju@@ di@@ th But@@ ler or Eri@@ c Z@@ em@@ m@@ our ?
Well , Jean , I like you a lot , and you are someone who is intelligent and cul@@ tured .
I said that about Ju@@ di@@ th in the vein of Fur@@ us@@ ato evo@@ king Ho@@ lo@@ fer@@ nes , a parallel which did not occur to me ( I do not have her shar@@ p@@ ness of mind ) .
Otherwise , all things considered , as you refer to it , this subject does not interest me , and , sincerely , I cannot see where the problem is : I would hope that you and your friends could get me out of my retar@@ dation , as I am slow but I understand well ...
@ Jean : reco@@ gni@@ ze that , cul@@ turally , sending Ju@@ di@@ th back to Ho@@ lo@@ fer@@ nes , that does it .

We are clearly no longer in the debate of ideas
This is something else , much deeper .
@ Jean , have you read that le Monde published an article on the necessity of the@@ ology ?
@ : As it was about a debate of ideas , I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources .
Inten@@ ding to combat ideas from the only report that their critics make of it ( Car@@ din@@ al R@@ at@@ z@@ ing@@ er , inven@@ tor of the Gen@@ der The@@ ory , or X L@@ acro@@ ix , the@@ o@@ logi@@ an ) does not seem to me to be very rigorous .
But anyway , as I was explaining to our friend from the U@@ M@@ P , that is the difference between having an enli@@ ghtened opinion and a simple opinion .
I am not sure , however , that he has understood the nu@@ ance .
I have not read Ju@@ di@@ th , the very symbolic thro@@ at sli@@ cer , I was pleased with the &quot; Second sex &quot; ( it is more from my time ) , which I believe is the source of &quot; the source &quot; , according to Lo &apos;s wishes .

However , there were improvements to railways in Scotland with their predecess@@ ors too , including British R@@ ail .

Over@@ coming a disease is nothing to do with merit .
Com@@ e on let &apos;s start over again ..
I &apos;@@ m not saying that it &apos;s T@@ H@@ E condition to cure , I &apos;@@ m saying that it H@@ EL@@ PS ..
Nothing to do with any merit ... !
As for the examples from your life , only you can judge them .
I &apos;@@ ll start over .
To insin@@ u@@ ate , if only for a moment , that one can deserve to get over an illness or that one can not deserve to get over it , is quite simply mon@@ s@@ trous .
The body follows or it does not follow .
A body which lets go , all over , in spite of will , in spite of confidence in the medicine , do you have the v@@ agu@@ est idea of what that means ?
S@@ or@@ ry to think the opposite , if , having a strong morale enables one to accept tough treatments more easily and to prepare on@@ es@@ el@@ f for them , to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them because of fear ...
Some@@ one who is fighting in medicine , is above all someone who trusts medicine ...
But if one pre@@ fers to leave it up to the &quot; lor@@ d &quot; , that &apos;s something else ...
Neither with merit nor with courage .
These considerations are characteristic of mor@@ alists .
When you catch a bu@@ g , a real one , you stri@@ p yourself of everything to the point of only becoming a z@@ om@@ bie .
Personally , I &apos;@@ ve caught two of them , bu@@ gs , big ones , and I &quot; fought &quot; , as these fine psycho@@ log@@ ists say , that completely esca@@ ped my mind .
At least this combat only consists of g@@ rit@@ ting one &apos;s te@@ eth , suffering like hel@@ l and taking the pun@@ ches .
I thought the case against Milosevic was decided and fin@@ aliz@@ ed about 10 years ago .
I ha@@ ven &apos;t seen the man &apos;s name in print in at least that long .
What &apos;s going on ?
It &apos;s an anniversary .
A forgotten one .
His trial was brought to an end &quot; swiftly &quot; and then swe@@ pt under the car@@ pet .
W@@ as this the story that was told back then ?
Commun@@ is@@ t-@@ tur@@ ne@@ d-@@ nation@@ alist who igni@@ ted three Balkan wars in the past decade ?
Communist president of a Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ?
Please , question the facts that are conveni@@ ently missed out : 1 .
Ex@@ plain how NATO bombing was legal under A@@ N@@ Y norms of international law .
What country did Serbia attack ?
When talking about R@@ TS ( Radi@@ o-@@ Tele@@ vi@@ sion-@@ Serbia ) why do you fail to mention how NATO ble@@ w up that same building killing civilians and then deemed it a valid target .
Milosevic was done however one fli@@ ps the coin : If he di@@ d@@ n &apos;t defend his country against NATO attack he would get cruci@@ fied as a trait@@ or .
If he did , he would get e@@ aten up by western justice system .
W@@ ester@@ ners deemed false flag and deta@@ ched part of a sovereign state wit@@ ch later unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was expressly reco@@ gni@@ zed by western states who proceeded to fl@@ at out lie about situation on the ground .
Serbian population now is non existent ( eth@@ nic@@ ally clean@@ sing ) .
Vo@@ j@@ isla@@ v Ko@@ st@@ un@@ ica who here is mentioned , politically died after his first term after failing to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end situation that had developed .
Zor@@ an Dj@@ in@@ dj@@ ic was one of most controversial figures in politics of that time .
In the end , Guar@@ dian staff should not call Milosevic a ty@@ rant ( as much as he was not popular among us ) .
As far as I know , only in Greece is there an earthquake pre@@ diction method that works more or less , by measuring the pie@@ zo@@ electri@@ c level in the quar@@ tz .
This type of study is indis@@ pu@@ tably useful and thank you for sharing the results with us .
A hope therefore , but caution should be exercised . This water has nothing to do with that of the ex@@ oplan@@ et named H@@ AT@@ -@@ P-@@ 11@@ b , located about 1@@ 24 light years away from Ear@@ th in the Cy@@ g@@ nu@@ s con@@ ste@@ l@@ lation , which is &quot; the smallest and col@@ dest planet to present detec@@ table water mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les &quot; , according to a study led by D@@ ra@@ ke Dem@@ ing and Jon@@ a@@ than Fra@@ ine &apos;s team from the University of Mar@@ y@@ land .
The method to be followed then .
Just like those which involve animals feeling threatened .
Thank you Pas@@ seur de sciences for treating us , often , to these experimental fe@@ ats which are achieved in the world .
How would animals know ( in advance ) ?
Un@@ doub@@ tedly by the perception of other elements whose rate evol@@ ves in the event of an earthquake .
Like ra@@ don , for example .
An od@@ or@@ less gas a priori for man but may be detected by animals .
All these methods are unde@@ tec@@ table by man , but not for the measuring instruments which they have at their disposal .
But we do not have reliable results on these clu@@ es ...
It was observed many a time ( and for centuries ) that certain animals act in a strange way for a few hours with an earthquake , particularly h@@ ens , cows , do@@ gs , but especially fish and s@@ na@@ kes .
I had seen a report on the arte channel telling of the fight of two scientific teams , one C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ an , the other Jap@@ anese , to ensure the recognition of the validity of their work which was about animals &apos; sensitivity to earth &apos;s mag@@ ne@@ tic fields , and more particularly about their modification before an earthquake .
Well of course I am not a scienti@@ st , but their hypo@@ th@@ eses had convinced me !
How far have we got on this research ?
Why so much contempt towards this line of research ?
We should learn how to listen to nature again ...
If one exam@@ ines things calm@@ ly and rigorously , one publi@@ shes it in a serious journal , and no one looks down on it .
As soon as we talk about &quot; signs &quot; given by animals , we come up against the same s@@ lant : everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the gol@@ d@@ fish was stran@@ gely going round in circles .
I don &apos;t understand why anyone thinks Bor@@ is will make a good T@@ ory Leader .
He has over reached himself as London Maj@@ or .
Lis@@ tening to the L@@ BC ph@@ one-@@ in and you can &apos;t help but thinking this man has@@ n &apos;t got a clu@@ e and is always desperate to dis@@ tract you with a jo@@ ke .
He never gives a straight answer to anything .
Another point he said was that he agreed with F@@ ar@@ age , then Nic@@ k Fer@@ rar@@ i the presen@@ ter asked what he agreed on ?
He cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;t name a single thing .
He made so many pledges to get elected as Maj@@ or and has@@ n &apos;t kept any .
S@@ imply underlines what a cro@@ ck of sh@@ 1@@ t the rest of the T Party are do@@ es@@ n &apos;t it ?
Because he &apos;s popular .
Because he &apos;s fun@@ ny .
He &apos;s been on Have I Go@@ t Ne@@ ws For you .
Because he &apos;s a celebr@@ ity and the people have been trained to wor@@ ship cele@@ bri@@ ties .
Lon@@ don@@ ers voted for him and so will the rest of the country .
When ( not if ) he takes over as leader , the T@@ ories poll ra@@ tings will go through the ro@@ of I &apos;@@ m certain .
God help us .
I am not so sure - the public love a jo@@ ke but don &apos;t necessarily want one for P@@ M
That &apos;s exactly what they said about Lon@@ don@@ ers .

It is understandable that the Austr@@ ali@@ ans , who know ( one of their heavy cru@@ is@@ ers , the Australia , must still be at the bottom since the battle of Sav@@ o ) , do not want to return there .
We actually went past the Is@@ land of Sav@@ o , in the &quot; Ir@@ on B@@ ot@@ tom S@@ ound &quot; .
Even if the mission is coming to an end .

Cal@@ cu@@ lating the k@@ ero@@ z@@ ene consu@@ med to reach the target totally undermines the concept ...

The thing is , the flag in that dron was@@ n &apos;t the flag of the actu@@ a , current Albania .
It was apparently the flag of Greater Albania , which encom@@ passes all regions where there is a significant presence of Albanians .
A bit of excessive nationalism , basically .
Than@@ k@@ fully , there were no significant casu@@ alties ( that I know of ) .
actually , it was the Albanian flag sha@@ ped like the map of not the so-called Greater Albania , but of Albania before 19@@ 13 , when the europe@@ an great powers decided do give give parts of the country to the neighbour countries .
How can one have felt &quot; an explosion of joy &quot; seeing two tow@@ ers collapse knowing that women , men and undoubtedly children were inside ?
How ? ?
What bo@@ thers me a little in this &quot; account &quot; , is the mere fact of having been able to , even if it was just once , be spontan@@ e@@ ously delighted at the horrible death of thousands of people ; in my eyes it bears witness to a &quot; border line &quot; personality , all the &quot; accounts &quot; of whom should be taken with the highest circum@@ spection .
No doubt that in the short moment of &quot; joy &quot; , one will not have thought of the dead nor the reality of the horror inflicted .
One will have only thought , for one instant , that , for once , Muslims had succeeded in truly and apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tically hur@@ ting the big bad Sa@@ tan in his heart itself .
Do@@ ing something powerful .
Something grand .
It would seem that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims consu@@ med by their feeling of humiliation .
With accounts fil@@ med in Palestine .
C@@ la@@ ssi@@ c Sch@@ ad@@ enfre@@ u@@ de .
We had some doubts .
The West &quot; Christian / white / Gau@@ ls &quot; cannot measure the degree of frustration , anger , hatred of the Muslim when he contempla@@ tes the general poverty , social and cultural under-@@ development of the Ara@@ b@@ -@@ Muslim world today .
I &apos;@@ m talking about the sub@@ ur@@ bs of Cairo or Al@@ gi@@ ers , not the tow@@ ers of Du@@ ba@@ i .
The former s@@ pl@@ end@@ or , certainly glori@@ fied is no con@@ so@@ lation , on the contrary .
How can the Muslim world get out of this di@@ abo@@ lical ho@@ le ?
En@@ ti@@ rely in agreement , 2 major po@@ isons run through the Arab World I : the bi@@ go@@ ted conserv@@ atis@@ m of the powers in authority and fasci@@ stic ni@@ hi@@ lism .
The thing in common , the suspension of thought and the ex@@ communication ( gen@@ tle or armed ) of their critical expression .
As may have been understood before , do not make the Muslims re@@ treat .
This is the only way .
Has E@@ d@@ w@@ y P@@ len@@ el read this article ?
In many countries I suspect that &apos;s true .

For the taxation on the increases for children , it is the amount collected by the State which essentially origin@@ ates from deci@@ les 8 to 10 .
But concerning the number of house@@ holds which have seen their taxes increase following this measures , the fourth and fifth deci@@ les ( medi@@ an incomes ) are those concerned above all according to di@@ agra@@ m 2 .
The abolition of the half-@@ share concerning above all wi@@ do@@ ws was not addressed at all in the article or rather its impact was completely under estimated : 2@@ 30 million euros is a jo@@ ke which does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is pain@@ less .
And it &apos;s not about to improve .

If for once the PS makes a policy that is left-@@ le@@ an@@ ing instead , we &apos;@@ re not going to cry ...
It is clear that those who make up the 20 % richest must bear much more than 75 % of the increase in taxes , why not 90 % ?
Contin@@ ue like this and you will encourage this 20 % to work less or to leave .
Well , I know , it &apos;s not politically correct , but I &apos;@@ m saying it anyway .
L@@ ong live the Tro@@ t@@ sk@@ y@@ ists and the OC@@ Is recycled in the PS : they understood everything .
Adam , you see badly what you are looking at .
The proportion is always the same , here or in B@@ ah@@ ra@@ in : 20 % of the population holds 80 % of the wealth .
F@@ air taxes is when it stops anyone from a@@ mas@@ sing as much as they can .
Be@@ yond a certain limit , money lo@@ ses all its usefulness .
And once the usefulness of money has been exceeded , money is not used for more than to make money , that is bring mis@@ fortune on as many as possible .
One is part of the richest 20 % .
Un@@ doub@@ tedly also of the 20 % of house@@ holds which work the most ( and create wealth , a part of which is logically re@@ distributed ) .
F@@ air tax must enable these house@@ holds to make the most of a part of their efforts .
Or better to give up and live on the social benefits , above all if one has social housing .

According to the link provided in the article :
To its credit , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &apos;s response to Tem@@ an was quick , almost absur@@ dly so .
Within 24 hours , per an e@@ mail provided to G@@ aw@@ ker by Tem@@ an , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b had sent a loc@@ k@@ sm@@ ith to change his loc@@ ks , made plans to put him up in a ho@@ tel for a week , and wi@@ red him $ 23@@ ,@@ 8@@ 17 ( of which Air@@ b@@ n@@ b itself is insu@@ red , but nonetheless ) .
So why is this article quoting Tem@@ an as compla@@ ining that there was no support from Air@@ b@@ n@@ b ?
L@@ O@@ V@@ E AI@@ R@@ B@@ N@@ B@@ - for host and travel

H@@ arm@@ less weapons then .
I am sure that it will please the families and lo@@ ved ones of millions of Kurds killed in H@@ alab@@ ja to learn that their parents and friends died from something other than Saddam Hussein &apos;s chemical bombar@@ d@@ ments .
Unless the content of this article was radically modified by the author , your comment is inappropriate ( to be poli@@ te ) .
Moreover , how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still us@@ able ?
The author &apos;s style is not really clear : &quot; looking for weapons of mass destruction .
We completely agree .
Do you believe that this is the moment to weaken the army to strengthen education
It is never the moment to strengthen education , as we are still at war .
Al@@ ter@@ native : Is it S@@ T@@ I@@ L@@ L the moment to strengthen education , as we are still at war ?
It would already strengthen education a lot if we made &quot; them &quot; work 35 hours instead of 17 .
Cur@@ ren@@ tly , our teachers earn at present more than engine@@ ers .
They cannot make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programme .
But that is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the school / high school for its teachers , so they work at home .
A sort of forced tele@@ work all in all , except that the employer does not pay for the computer , nor the internet connection , nor the supplies .
Moreover , it is so cu@@ sh@@ y with 17 hours a week and 4 months of holi@@ days that we cannot manage to fill the ma@@ ths CA@@ P@@ ES ex@@ am , come on , we &apos;@@ re waiting for you .
How does that not make you want to put up with poorly educated bra@@ ts whose parents sp@@ it on you treating you like a little sh@@ it ?
I think that the priority in this area is to dis@@ arm the j@@ i@@ had@@ ists so that the Kurdish population can flour@@ ish better .

S@@ cra@@ p the mic@@ key m@@ ouse degrees such as art / eng@@ lish / drama / media / philosophy / politics or dole studies as they &apos;@@ re known .
I had one of those degrees and ended up as a production manag@@ er .
Tur@@ ned out what was important was not the degree but as the article above indicated , a strong employment history , starting at school and continuing through University .
Gran@@ ted the starting salary was lower but you soon move through the ranks as out in the real world it becomes more about being a do@@ er than a know@@ er .
This engineering / arts b@@ alls has been running for years .
Scienti@@ sts are not the cure for every problem , it &apos;s more important to be able to get up , turn in on time and deal with people in a way that gets things done .

That is ridiculous .
Presu@@ mably you mean degrees such as media studies and whatever Phi@@ lis@@ tin@@ ism subject you studied .
English , Ph@@ il@@ osop@@ h@@ y , Poli@@ tics and Ar@@ t are serious degrees .
We need people who can explain the big issues to high school@@ ers - who can understand and champion pillars of culture such as liter@@ ature and art et al .
Would a genuine territorial policy not be better to clear Paris and dyna@@ mi@@ ze the rest of France ?
Personally , I cannot see the inhabitants of the very de@@ p@@ ths of Es@@ s@@ onne and the Val@@ -d &apos;O@@ ise doing 8@@ 0@@ km there and back every day by bic@@ ycle to come to work in Paris .
The inhabitants from the in@@ ner city and the in@@ ner ring road already have many much more practical means of public transport ( metro , bus , tra@@ m ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Several secured and locked par@@ ks , as already exist in cities in the North of Europe , in Di@@ j@@ on or in Ly@@ on , will be instal@@ led on the roads .
Good idea .
On the surface , the space is can@@ ni@@ b@@ aliz@@ ed by 2@@ R@@ Ms .
Incidentally , one hopes that the city of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and from Denmark .
Mi@@ ght as well benefit from their extensive experience in the field .
Well , we have not found a place for A S@@ I@@ NG@@ LE bic@@ ycle ra@@ ck .
Mo@@ tiv@@ ation seems to be greater when it involves finding an office for Ber@@ tr@@ and Del@@ ano@@ ë …
Well , that is no good at all .
When you argue with pedestri@@ ans and other public transport users about the reasons why they do not pe@@ dal , it seems to me that the principal reasons which stand out are : 1 / it is so dangerous with all these cars , lorries , sco@@ o@@ ters which drive extremely fast and do not give a dam@@ n about the survival of bic@@ y@@ cles 2 / we take a lot of pollution into our body . For me cy@@ cling lan@@ es are a last resort , car traffic must be reduced ( urban toll like a congestion charge ) , speed reduced ( Paris = 30 zone ) , enforce the high@@ way code by systematically boo@@ king off@@ enders ( even for bic@@ y@@ cles except that it is necessary to adapt the high@@ way code written for cars 100 years ago to bic@@ y@@ cles ) , extend the bu@@ ffer zones after the z@@ ebra cross@@ ings , not before , otherwise cars and sco@@ o@@ ters do not interfere with each other .
Cy@@ cling lan@@ es is apartheid , we must co-@@ exist but balance the occupation of urban space .
Nothing on bic@@ y@@ cles in greater Paris ?
Not a word on bic@@ ycle sp@@ aces on public transport ?
E@@ EL@@ V is right .
The goal of 15 % of tri@@ ps by bic@@ ycle is ridiculous .
I am starting to believe that An@@ ne Hi@@ d@@ algo du@@ ped the gre@@ ens .
Furthermore , according to what O@@ R reports , the E@@ EL@@ V assistants seem s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical .
I prefer to be optimistic .
Before the sha@@ ke@@ down begins you &apos;@@ d better find out who was really behind the massacre .

That sounds terrible .

A lawyer has expressed an intention to bring a case before the ECH@@ R , but I &apos;@@ ve seen no reports of a case actually having been fi@@ led .
Also , they would have to file a law@@ suit in Germany or Ukraine first .
I would also expect that such cases would be delayed to wait for the outcome of the air cra@@ sh investigation and the criminal investigation which would follow it .
Y@@ e@@ ah but Libya di@@ d@@ n &apos;t blow up P@@ an A@@ m 103 either .
Mal@@ ay@@ sia Air@@ lines are not at fault , the fault lies with the authority tas@@ ked with the safety of the air space , in this case the government of Ukraine .
W@@ as the accident foreseeable ?
Other je@@ ts were shot down previously , Ukraine was launching a@@ eri@@ al assau@@ l@@ ts on rebels in the area and they would of course see any aircraft as a possible , immediate threat .
Di@@ d the Ukraine government take reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or did it choose to g@@ amble the lives of the innocent in order to collect lucra@@ tive fly over fees from airlines ?
W@@ ere are all the pro Kiev tro@@ lls defending their coup Government / the ul@@ tra nation@@ alists of West Ukraine - and arguing that Putin basically shot down M@@ H@@ 17 .
As far as I know there is already a legal action against Kiev &apos;s government as they are responsible for what goes on in their sk@@ ies .
The precedent : A judgment by the International Court of Justice in 1986 held that the supply of weapons to the Con@@ tra re@@ bel forces in Nicaragua by the CI@@ A did not mean America was responsible for their actions .
The chances of Russia allowing this to go to the IC@@ J are zero .
It &apos;s fun@@ ny to think that Ab@@ bot@@ t wants to tell Putin that Austr@@ ali@@ ans were murdered by Russian backed rebels .
I hope that he can produce the evidence to back up his claims .
So far the investig@@ ators have not said any of such things .

It is easy to read , I took a few days .
It shows the statistical evolution of income / production , income / capital , inequalities / concentration , the inequality of income from work , of ownership of capital , merit and heritage in the long term ..
It shows that the concentration of capital today is returning to that of the start of the 20@@ th Cen@@ tury before 19@@ 14 , it shows that it is the 2 world wars that made the concentration of capital drop , from 19@@ 14 to 19@@ 45 , and then how the concentration pic@@ ks up after ...

I am asking you how long it took you to read this huge article knowing that an individual &apos;s concentration capacity has limits .
Next , the question is not knowing whether it is easy to read .
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis that the press has given of it is fair or not .
If it is fair , one can debate it without having read the book , which essentially involves arguing one side in favor of this one .
No , it is not easy to read ...
Ber@@ na@@ ju@@ zan : how long did it take you to read it ?
Is the central thesis of this huge book sum@@ mari@@ zed by the press false ?
I have not read it and I will not read it .
I therefore trust the summary of its central thesis and it is that which seems to be a clear sha@@ m .
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary .
Has humanity not become globally rich ?
And this enrich@@ ment added to the population growth is the real political issue today .
Mal@@ ala Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ f@@ z@@ ai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without a doubt .
But remember that she is only 17 years old .
An age where most people are just beginning to find their place in the world .
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the gir@@ l and that she will find her way to lead a lu@@ ck@@ y life .
The prize is@@ n &apos;t its the political capital from western governments wanting to prove the old ad@@ age of devi@@ ant dar@@ k@@ ies being evil evil evil .
I wish Mal@@ ala all the best in life but she has to realise that she is being used and nothing will be done to edu@@ cate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else - even in working class areas in Britain !
Di@@ d anyone think her speech was a little strange .
She lau@@ ded her father for giving her freedom yet mentioned that were she not where she is now she would have been married off at 14 .
Is@@ n &apos;t Mal@@ ala herself one of those &quot; devi@@ ant dar@@ k@@ ies &quot; ?
You should not be given &apos; air time &apos; on this site .
You are , yourself , a horrible devi@@ ant .
How absolutely dis@@ gus@@ ting .
No her father was@@ n &apos;t going to mar@@ ry her off at 14 .
She was 15 when she was shot .
Her father runs a school where girls are educated and is in favor of equal rights for women .
He is and was in favor of her both getting a university education and having the right to decide her own marriage plans .
However he is an unusual Pakistan@@ i man in that he believes women are equal to men .
She was saying the average Pakistan@@ i gir@@ l is often looking at marriage by the time she is 14 with no choice in the matter .
S@@ or@@ ry she di@@ d@@ n &apos;t phrase it ar@@ t@@ fully enough for you .
It may seem to be a contradiction , but , maybe she means that without her father giving her freedom she would have been married at 14
Rather disappointed by this opening to seas@@ on 4 and particularly by J@@ es@@ sica Lange who visi@@ bly found it difficult to find her double character , Mar@@ len@@ e Di@@ e@@ tr@@ ich .
I have just wat@@ ched the last two seas@@ ons , which are quite different , but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series , one of the most accomplished !
A fascin@@ ating first episo@@ de .
The production is close to perfe@@ ction and the show with J@@ es@@ sica Lange sing@@ ing the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ istic Life on M@@ ars by Bo@@ wi@@ e is quite simply ama@@ zing .
I ha@@ ven &apos;t wat@@ ched this new series yet ( which will be the last for me , without Lange me@@ h ) .
In the case of American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r S@@ tory I preferred to watch it all in one go to watching 13 episo@@ des spread over 3 to 4 months .
But one thing is sure , apart from extraordinary J@@ es@@ sica Lange , it is above all the risks in the sta@@ ging and edi@@ ting which sta@@ gger me .
In A@@ H@@ S we have an aval@@ an@@ che of original sh@@ ots which ridicule the a@@ sep@@ tiz@@ ation of today &apos;s productions quite well .
I don &apos;t quite understand why you throw in the tow@@ el in advance for the next seas@@ ons without even waiting to be able to gau@@ ge the quality .
J@@ es@@ sica Lange is certainly one of the main@@ sta@@ ys in this series , but , as you said so well , there are many other things .
No , it is simply that , for me , J@@ es@@ sica Lange ( and above all her voice and the way in which she uses it ) is truly ON@@ E of the pillars of the series apart from some technical qualities .
And well I watch it a lot for her .
Then I find that the series is flawed by its writing , it wants to do too many things at the same time .
Se@@ as@@ on 3 was slightly below par , in the 2@@ n@@ d it was too fragmented despite some excellent episo@@ des .
I do not see them doing 10 seas@@ ons of American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r S@@ tory or it is going to finish like 24 otherwise .
But anyway everyone does what they want to , e@@ h !
It is not because I say &quot; I will not watch any@@ more afterwards &quot; that everyone is obliged to do the same !
I simply share my point of view , nothing more , nothing less .
The loss of J@@ es@@ sica Lange , I think that it will be fatal for it .
But , after all , this is just my opinion .
L@@ ess talk of tax rises , please - just get on with sla@@ shing state spending .
No , let &apos;s increase spending please .
The sla@@ sh@@ ers have failed .
P@@ ic@@ king nois@@ y fi@@ ghts over relatively modest ch@@ un@@ ks of expenditure , such as foreign aid
The problem is that it is less than the margin of error for Government expenditure in the UK .
The reality is that we are all talking about a differ@@ ne@@ ce in emphasis rather than the change in direction that voters appear to want and all the while some on all sides pretend that the difference is emphasis is something much more significant and substantial - and the voters see through that as being dis@@ ingenu@@ ous .
L@@ ess than 1@@ p@@ c of managed expenditure .
The &quot; debt &quot; are assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country .
The &quot; debt &quot; is nothing to panic about .
I would be relax@@ ed about the government appropri@@ ating one third of my income ( before we get on to taxes on spending ) if I felt it would use it wis@@ ely .
But I don &apos;t and many taxpayers feel the same .
Nig@@ el F@@ ar@@ age is alleged to be less than honest about how taxes can be reduced but then again if you add up our EU net contribution , overseas aid , H@@ S@@ 2 , subsidies to ne@@ ar-@@ useless wind farms and nuclear power stations that cost double what they should you come to a figure that makes Labour &apos;s / Lib@@ -@@ De@@ m &apos;s man@@ sion tax seem very small be@@ er .
Your first £ 10@@ ,@@ 000 is tax free .
This means that someone ear@@ ning £ 3@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 a year will pay about £ 5@@ ,@@ 000 ( a seventh of their salary ) , someone on £ 5@@ 0,@@ 000 would pay around £ 10@@ ,@@ 000 ( a fifth ) , etc , and someone on £ 200@@ ,@@ 000 pays around £ 7@@ 0,@@ 000 ( just over a third ) .
National insurance ?
Plus national insurance , plus council tax , plus par@@ king charges and road tax , and that &apos;s before VAT .
Almost exactly 30 % of my money is taken at source before council tax and road tax .
I &apos;@@ m dec@@ ently paid , but not wil@@ dly so .
Not that this is wrong , of course , I &apos;@@ m happy to pay my taxes .
But let &apos;s not pretend that there &apos;s a ma@@ gic money tre@@ e , or that what happens to billions of poun@@ ds of taxes do@@ es@@ n &apos;t matter .
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work door to door prove it ?
Even though 20 % of unemployed people were not looking , that means that 80 % are looking and don &apos;t find anything .
As an unemployed person myself , would it be better for me if the others look or not ?
If a potential recru@@ iter receives 10 or 20 C@@ V@@ s , that increases my chances in proportion .
In fact , I ha@@ ven &apos;t had any news from the employment cen@@ ter for months ; that means that the agents are bu@@ si@@ er with monitoring operations than with bringing back job adver@@ ti@@ sements ?
I don &apos;t see the interest .
Because it is not up to the State to provide the jobs .
If the employment cen@@ ter does not provide enough posts , then one must do without the employment cen@@ ter .
How is this a sensitive subject ?
We all have rights and duties , in this case we make sure that unemployed people fulf@@ ill their duties in return for their rights .
Just like a conductor asks for transport tic@@ kets from users of transport , or a head of department the employees about their work , etc .
No one calls it a scandal in this case , right ?
It is indeed good to recall that unemployed people have rights : the only two times that I have dealt with the employment cen@@ ter , my rights to the ARE were badly established , and on one of the files , cut drastically by 40 % , it was necessary to fight a tough battle .
That takes time !
I am not an expert on law .
Recor@@ ding information and monitoring take precedence now , while statu@@ tori@@ ly the employment cen@@ ter is close to being , in fact , an insurance company .
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees , they are the ones who pay the contributions .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans and French non-@@ employees grant themselves rights which they do not in fact have !
This is not normal .
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the improved status of employed work .
awaiting for disastrous tw@@ e@@ ets in ar@@ abi@@ c ...
In fact it is important to have a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop I@@ sis so that this virus does not reach that war zone .
This situation would then mi@@ rro@@ r the situation of the spread of the Black De@@ ath in 13@@ 48 / 9 connected to war and the dis@@ placement of people then .
The Sau@@ dis have had the good sense to ban Muslim P@@ il@@ gri@@ ms from the 3 affected nations from making the Ha@@ j to Me@@ c@@ ca this year .
El P@@ ais reports 7@@ 400 were turned down for visas be@@ cu@@ ase of nation of origin or previous travel .
There was actually a case of a pil@@ gri@@ m from Bosnia contracting small@@ po@@ x in Me@@ c@@ ca during a Ha@@ j in th 8@@ 0s , probably from a pil@@ gri@@ m from som@@ alia were it was still holding out .
Now let &apos;s see some good sense in the rest of the world .
Is it call@@ ous to propose that we stop flying people with E@@ bo@@ la into Europe ?
I thought it pure common sense but apparently those &apos; in the know &apos; decided a g@@ amble with the lives of 10@@ ,@@ 000 &apos;s is o@@ kay ..@@ ..
Those West African countries where E@@ bo@@ la is out of control should be ke@@ p under strict quar@@ anti@@ ne .
Nobody leaves .
Only healthcare workers allowed in .
A wait of 21 days after treating a patient before they can themselves leave .
If they contract E@@ bo@@ la while sta@@ tioned there , they remain until they recover .
These are not dra@@ con@@ ian measures .
Just during the past week people have been coming down with the illness who have had contacts with people in west Africa despite taking &apos; all necessary precautions &apos; .
The spread of this disease y@@ ay be stopped .
It is being spread mainly via airlines .
Sto@@ p them from operating in those countries .
Also , customs agents at airports should be trained to be on the loo@@ k@@ out for those with E@@ bo@@ la@@ - like symptom@@ s so those who do can be put in immediate quar@@ anti@@ ne .
If he man@@ ages to pass the message on of the individual first and of the group ( including religious ones ) second and he will have deser@@ ved the Nobel peace prize .

He is still far away from this design .

What is the point of becoming an ump@@ teenth Pro@@ tes@@ tant church ?
For those who have not noticed , Catho@@ li@@ cism is largely a minority in France today , no one is forced to stick to it .
Those who critici@@ ze would not in any event set foot in the Church , one only has to see the low number of Pro@@ tes@@ tants in France .
What is the next stage , we remove the notion of sin , too &quot; anxi@@ e@@ ty-@@ provo@@ king &quot; ?
@ lou@@ ise : S@@ or@@ ry , the church does not have a vision limited to France .
And in the world , maybe that would make it possible to reach more people ...
@ Mar@@ tine E , to be honest ( as usual ) the respect for others such as you envisage existed before Chris@@ t .
H@@ il@@ le@@ l already said one century before him : &quot; do not do to your neigh@@ b@@ or that which you do not want him to do to you , this is the whole of the Tor@@ ah and the rest is com@@ mentary : go forth and study ! &quot; .
Christi@@ an@@ ity goes far beyond simple recipro@@ city but it introduces ag@@ ap@@ e .
Your &quot; advance justice , peace , fra@@ tern@@ ity &quot; but without God ?
Is it a return to commun@@ ism ? : - )
Next stage : we remove the incar@@ nation and the re@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion .
J@@ es@@ us will remain this h@@ ero who turned moral laws up@@ side down by re@@ defining respect for others .
Christians will then be ready to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice , peace , fra@@ tern@@ ity .
Not very Catholic ?
I think that I recall that the low number of Pro@@ tes@@ tants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their an@@ ces@@ tors were ex@@ termin@@ ated and then conver@@ ted by force and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago .
I am so tor@@ n between getting this , the new Ali@@ en game or W@@ as@@ te@@ land 2 .

Be@@ ware though that the P@@ C version is D@@ x@@ 11 only .

S@@ ay , this Nobel prize looks to me to be a pois@@ oned cha@@ li@@ ce .
One must love the France of the 4@@ 0s , the one with the &quot; strange defeat &quot; ?
When one sees who w@@ ins the Nobel in liter@@ ature , one asks on@@ es@@ el@@ f if Pro@@ ust or D@@ os@@ to@@ ï@@ ev@@ sky would have it today .
The Nobel is not even an event , we do not even want to read the winning authors .
Are Braz@@ i@@ li@@ ans , Chinese or Austr@@ ali@@ ans going to read Mo@@ di@@ ano , which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a univer@@ se so limited and ego@@ cen@@ tric ?
I hope that the other N@@ ob@@ els are more credible , but frankly I doubt it .
Mo@@ di@@ ano , Lev@@ y , Mus@@ so are only remo@@ tely connected to liter@@ ature .
Have you read him at least ?
Or another Nobel prize winner ?
This would be better to judge .
As for the Chinese , the Braz@@ i@@ li@@ ans and others , do not worry about them .
Fore@@ ign@@ ers are very sensitive to French liter@@ ature and culture , them .
They will know how to appreciate M@@ r.
Mo@@ di@@ ano &apos;s true value , if they do not already know him !
For your part , continue to see L@@ é@@ v@@ y and Mus@@ so .
I agree with you .
Mar@@ c Lev@@ y and Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ me Mus@@ so keep all their chances .
Now let &apos;s see who won the Nobel prize in liter@@ ature : H@@ .

The drive back on Sunday was painful .

Read a little Bud@@ d@@ ha and you will understand to what extent you are making a mistake , dear Christian .
Having said that , without wishing to an@@ no@@ y you , I believe that you are moving a little away from the subject .
This famous totali@@ ty , it prohi@@ bits se@@ ar@@ ches for j@@ i@@ had@@ ists at the ex@@ it of mos@@ ques .
It signals without delay trafficking in arms .
One either has large open eyes like Med@@ de@@ b and Ta@@ ï@@ a or Bou@@ ba@@ ker , or one has large closed eyes .
A choice must be made .
It is not by keeping one &apos;s eyes closed that one steps into the light .
Ex@@ cu@@ se me , dear Christian , but once again , you make a monu@@ mental mis@@ interpretation : all the authorities , organiz@@ ations or representative associations , Muslim or not , have formally condemned El and his crimes , the French , Muslims or not , have noting to add to these official unanimous condem@@ nations .
He who does not say a word consen@@ ts .
The problem is that people like you see them first of all as Muslims , Ara@@ bs or Africans .
Not as French .
Unfortunately , dear Ken@@ to@@ c &apos;@@ h Mer@@ vel , the doubt exists for everyone .
As I have said thousands of times , some have doubts about the approval by French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza , but it would be stupid and inde@@ cent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they publicly demonstrate in order to prove to the rest of the French society that they are wrong to doubt them .
This principle is , to my mind , the denial of the re@@ public and can only contribute towards cru@@ mb@@ ling French society .
If there is no doubt , one might as well say it .
He who does not say a word consen@@ ts , but consen@@ ts to what ?
Con@@ sen@@ ts to clo@@ sen@@ ess to El or condemnation of El .
Sil@@ ence is very useful , it is the principal weapon of those who wish to try to please everyone .
Your position is intellectu@@ ally honest but prag@@ matically indefen@@ sible .
Ale@@ x Sal@@ mon@@ d has predic@@ ted Scotland could “ exact reven@@ ge ” on the W@@ est@@ min@@ ster parties at the ballot box because a huge gap has opened up between their proposals for de@@ volution and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum .
Cam@@ eron must be pe@@ tri@@ fied at the thought of losing all those W@@ est@@ min@@ ster seats ...
Cam@@ eron must be lau@@ gh@@ ing his arse off .
What kind of threat is that ?
The T@@ ories don &apos;t give a sh@@ it about Scotland as they have no power base there .
They can do whatever they like with total electoral impunity .
I doubt even Cam@@ eron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing W@@ est@@ min@@ ster seats to the S@@ NP is a good thing for him and the tories in the long run .
Who will share a tear for the Labour Party .
Fac@@ ing a total wh@@ i@@ p out in Scotland from the S@@ NP and U@@ K@@ IP breaking down their ne@@ ck up north .
E@@ d Mi@@ lib@@ and sign up to the &quot; VO@@ W &quot; believing he was saving his party but di@@ d@@ n &apos;t understand he was signing off the ob@@ itu@@ ary of his Scottish M@@ Ps .
No wonder some Labour M@@ Ps are asking questions of the Leader .
If the S@@ NP win 20@@ -@@ 25 seats in a hun@@ g parliament situation , even if the seats don &apos;t come from the T@@ ories , then they are in a very powerful bargaining position in terms of any coalition and a threat to both the T@@ ories and Labour in terms of making them do what they &apos;@@ d say about dev@@ o ma@@ x .
Th@@ ink that &apos;s more the point .
Not if Labour or the T@@ ories ever want to get elected in England again .
Su@@ cking up to 8 % at the expense of the 85 % is@@ n &apos;t great electoral strategy .
Plus once the Scottish M@@ Ps can &apos;t vote on English matters the T@@ ories will win every vote .
O@@ h I think he is .
Cam@@ eron might not have much to lose , but Mil@@ lib@@ and certainly does .

Yet he &apos;s still on course to be P@@ M in 2015 , and has been since he won the leadership of the Labour Party .

It is unclear from the report whether Iran was giving a dire warning of retribu@@ tion or coun@@ sel@@ ing circum@@ spection .
It ’ s more likely the latter is the case and at any rate , the st@@ un@@ ning thing is that the US@@ -@@ Iranian diplomatic engagement today covers Syria , Israel and regional security .
Indian P@@ un@@ ch@@ line is highly recommended reading for anyone paying attention to detail as opposed the B@@ S pushed in certain stream@@ s of the M@@ S@@ M - the small piece you &apos;@@ ve linked is an important one and should be read in the same light as previous warnings / reali@@ st observations which came out of Iran regarding Afghanistan cir@@ ca late 1979 - 1980 &apos;s .
Who are these &apos; moder@@ ates &apos; ear@@ n@@ estly fighting the the terrible secular As@@ sad simultaneously the devi@@ ants of IS@@ IS ?

I don &apos;t know why there are so many s@@ ni@@ ff@@ y comments down here about what Paul Mas@@ on is saying , perhaps they are from fol@@ k who were never co@@ ol even for a couple of years !
I think there &apos;s some football stories for you to comment on in the S@@ ports section .
To@@ p article , true .
Since the Tony Par@@ son &apos;s film , there has been a de@@ ar@@ th of coverage that really does reflect the actu@@ ality of Northern culture .
It is hardly a surprise that Paul Mas@@ on has got the social and political context right , he understands things .
Northern sou@@ l is still alive , but it has been v@@ am@@ pi@@ red by capitalism , and is now largely a surface phenomena .
That said you can di@@ p you to@@ e in it if you are in the London area in November - 9@@ 9@@ p@@ sou@@ l will once more be sp@@ in@@ ning sou@@ l vin@@ y@@ l with lots of Northern on Saturday 15 November at F@@ ar@@ r@@ ing@@ don &apos;s B@@ et@@ se@@ y Tro@@ two@@ od .

Things are becoming more and more pois@@ on@@ ous .
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace .
Unfortunately , Ne@@ tan@@ y@@ ah@@ ou never mis@@ ses a chance to miss a chance to negotiate peace .
@ Jon@@ a@@ than : Ne@@ tan@@ y@@ ah@@ ou is not looking for peace , since he wants to continue to occup@@ y-@@ coloni@@ ze ( besides , this was also the case with Rab@@ in ) .
It is clear that Rab@@ in , Ne@@ tan@@ y@@ ah@@ ou and their elec@@ tors all preferred occupa@@ tion-@@ coloni@@ z@@ ation to peace .
He took off his clo@@ th@@ es , put them down on the ro@@ ck and entered the water .
An Israeli had stolen them from him .
The Israeli representative got up in anger and shou@@ ted : &quot; What are you talking about ?
The Israelis we@@ ren &apos;t even there at the time ! &quot;
The Palestinian representative ( UN ) s@@ mi@@ led and added : and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no faith in the Palestinian authority &apos;s bi@@ po@@ lar government and it will not drop its guard ...
That this dis@@ pleas@@ es the anti-@@ Israelis is obvious , this is not the goal sought ...
Anti-@@ Z@@ ion@@ ist : But I answered you , I translate : the global geopolitical relationship ...
And it is still like this since Poli@@ tics have been glob@@ aliz@@ ed ...
A@@ voi@@ dance , avoi@@ dance ...
In the Israeli@@ -@@ coloni@@ alist conflict , for the creation of the Palestinian state , it is certain , it continues !
For the creation of Israel you have not answered .
Which power relationship allowed the creation of Israel ?
Anti-@@ Z@@ ion@@ ist : the Israeli@@ -@@ Palestinian conflict is still really a power relationship today !
Do you doubt that ? ! ! ! ...
It &apos;s about a lot more than Rus@@ sell B@@ r@@ and as well , yet the Guar@@ dian &apos;s writ@@ ers seem to struggle to get beyond anything he do@@ es@@ n &apos;t have to say .
A lot of what he says is gh@@ os@@ tw@@ rit@@ ten sub-@@ C@@ hom@@ sk@@ y@@ ian wo@@ o
This shows you don &apos;t understand what Rus@@ sell B@@ r@@ and is saying , or what No@@ am C@@ hom@@ sky is saying .
Just a collection of personal attacks and insin@@ u@@ ations ( my 13@@ -@@ year-old daughter likes him , im@@ plying it &apos;s to do with im@@ matur@@ ity ) .
A really mean spi@@ ri@@ ted attack , with just a h@@ int of awareness that Rus@@ sell B@@ r@@ and is speaking some truth , maybe a truth that is too much to think about .
H@@ old on to your h@@ at , there &apos;s going to be a lot more of this sentiment coming !
I can understand why B@@ r@@ and ru@@ bs some people up the wrong way - can be preten@@ tious in his delivery and after all the tab@@ lo@@ id nonsense he does come across as a jo@@ h@@ n@@ n@@ y-@@ com@@ e-@@ la@@ tely popu@@ list , but this whole not voting thing has been completely mis@@ interpreted in my opinion .
The general consensus seems to be that he is just telling people not to vote and to put their feet up instead and ignore the whole political process - but if you watch the Pa@@ x@@ man interview and other articles / vi@@ deos he &apos;s pos@@ ted , he &apos;s saying merely voting once every 5 years for Labour or Conservative ( or the Li@@ b Dem@@ s I gu@@ ess ) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely pointless , as both parties ( to slightly differing exten@@ ts ) are basically ruling for vested interests , corporate multi-@@ nationals and the wealthy , At no point does he just say ignore politics completely as these parties are@@ n &apos;t ruling in our name - he makes a big point of saying that instead of merely voting and swit@@ ching off for 5 years , people should become far more politically active from a gras@@ s@@ roots level , agi@@ tate , protest , petition , whatever and try to influence politics from this level .
I &apos;@@ m not saying I necessarily agree with his solution ( as I think being politically active in terms of making demands can go hand in hand with voting as politicians are a fic@@ k@@ le lot who will change their tune if there is a real prospect of them being voted out of office ) , but it is an@@ no@@ ying seeing all these patron@@ ising responses saying the sil@@ ly J@@ es@@ us man is telling the youth to not b@@ other voting and just hope for the best as it is mis@@ -@@ representing his argument .
His solution is extremely deba@@ table , and it would be nice if people would debate what he actually means rather than just label him irresponsible and side@@ line the concerns that he and a huge amount of dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ised people hold .
Yes - thank you .
The voting thing has been entirely mis@@ represented .
I deeply res@@ ent the poin@@ t@@ lessness of a cross on a piece of paper every 5 years when my vote do@@ es@@ n &apos;t even bloody well count .
I want more referenda on issues , voting by ho@@ le in the wall technology , direct democracy and M@@ Ps locally accountable to the electorate .
Also , I take issue with the suggestion that Rus@@ sell B@@ r@@ and &apos;s words are not his own ( gh@@ os@@ tw@@ rit@@ ten ) .
He &apos;s intelligent enough to come up with his own words and ideas , even if they have been heavily influenced by the kind of anti-@@ establishment , counter@@ cultural thin@@ kers and acade@@ mics that Su@@ zan@@ ne would happi@@ ly lu@@ mp into one &quot; sub-@@ C@@ hom@@ sk@@ y@@ ian wo@@ o &quot; box .
I &apos;@@ m pretty sure he &apos;@@ d get Su@@ zan@@ ne on@@ side in a conversation .
Maybe that &apos;s what te@@ h Guar@@ dian could do , get Su@@ zan@@ ne to do a Pol@@ ly To@@ yn@@ be@@ e and to interview Rus@@ sell on a ver@@ anda complete with no@@ d@@ ding responses edi@@ ted in !
Like Ma@@ x Ke@@ iser , who started out bai@@ ting Rus@@ sel but ended up a f@@ an , inviting him on his show , it &apos;s all too easy to attack him without really getting where he &apos;s coming from .
He ta@@ ps into a political n@@ arra@@ tive that exists through the generations , but which has been margin@@ alised by main@@ stream media - including the Guar@@ dian - for generations .
This &quot; rebel@@ lion &quot; reveals above all to my mind that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the His@@ tory Me@@ e@@ tings , where professional histori@@ ans have become the minority and where exchanges among specialists have become poorer to the benefit of conden@@ sed read@@ y-@@ made thinking typical of Political Sci@@ ences for press rele@@ ases .
For my part , I saw in Pi@@ erre Bour@@ di@@ eu &apos;s intellectual attitude , as well as in Michel F@@ ou@@ cau@@ lt &apos;s , a need to target a cul@@ prit , a sca@@ pe@@ go@@ at .
They both develop very rational lines of argument , but this ration@@ ality is based on these sca@@ pe@@ go@@ ats , which are the ke@@ y@@ stone of their thoughts .
I believe rather that for F@@ ou@@ cau@@ lt the State was essential as the cul@@ prit .
This stems from a very ar@@ cha@@ ic way of thinking , sacri@@ ficial thinking , which is also ma@@ gic thinking .
The problem with the relationship with the other is solved by eliminating it .
There is an an@@ archi@@ zing , neo-@@ li@@ b and / or liber@@ tarian inclin@@ ation ( of the two terms the second marks a reinforcement of the desire to eliminate the State , the first knowing how to find help from the State for its deals ) meaning less State / no State at all in F@@ ou@@ cau@@ lt .
The old dream of the base which organiz@@ es itself beau@@ ti@@ fully .
His thinking is built on the culpa@@ bility of the State : without this culpa@@ bility it does not hold up .
Where there is a cul@@ prit , there is also elimination , murder , sacrifice .
This is not taking a stand against the three intellectu@@ als quoted here .
Nor support for that matter .
The totalitarian left re@@ members the good old days , those of God back then , Sta@@ lin , the little father of the people .
O@@ o@@ h la la , you undoubtedly read a little too fast if you took F@@ ou@@ cau@@ lt &apos;s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apo@@ logi@@ a for K@@ home@@ in@@ i .
Today , even Pi@@ erre Man@@ ent would not enjoy attacking Michel any more in this way .
Gau@@ chet presents a deep reflection about the con@@ temporary individual and the group , on the difficulty posed by the mechanism for support in our liberal advanced societies .
Whether one agrees with him or not , he is an original and respectable thin@@ ker .
Se@@ eing this plo@@ t or@@ ch@@ es@@ trated by researchers of human sciences from the hard left who cannot bear that we do very well without al@@ legi@@ ance to their man@@ tras is quite lau@@ g@@ hable .
The nar@@ cis@@ si@@ s@@ m and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism of these people has no limits .
An important point to add seems to me to be the position of these &quot; rebels &quot; , which is only intellectual and theoretical .
The attitudes I &apos;@@ ve witnessed in Russia towards the Chinese and other &quot; y@@ el@@ low@@ s &quot; are absolutely ja@@ w dro@@ pping .
You ha@@ ven &apos;t had the pleasure of hearing our Austr@@ ali@@ an friends on that topic , then .
And where in Russia was that , that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion ?
I for@@ got when I saw a Chinese last .
In London , and they were friendly to me , when learned I am Russian .
In Russia here - in 199@@ 0-@@ s the last time , in a market .
The views of Chinese towards white people is similar !
My family has lived in Australia since coming over from Hong Kong and Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou way back in the mid-@@ 20@@ th century and I still hear very extreme anti-@@ white opinions from some of them .
My dad is not happy that his el@@ dest grand-@@ daughter is dating a white bo@@ y .
Also I believe that attitudes in Russia have changed since the 1990s and especially in the last few years : they are becoming more prosperous , the prosperity is spreading outside major cities , and with that prosperity people are travelling overseas and seeing how others live .
From what others have told me , most Russian prejudice has been against temporary un@@ skilled workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia , working in occupa@@ tions and living in areas where they are likely to be exploited by their employers or exposed to high levels of crime and violence .
Th@@ ough I lived on banks of Y@@ en@@ is@@ ey river , in Si@@ bi@@ ria .
Sadly , I &apos;@@ ve heard Austr@@ ali@@ an opinions on both the Chinese and Ab@@ ori@@ gon@@ als .
It is very strange that a foreign@@ er tells me that I can &apos;t stand Chinese , when I met two in my life ( once was abroad ) , don &apos;t have any bad mem@@ o@@ irs , people as people , and , actually , the London ones were very friendly that &apos;s why I remembered at all that they were Chinese .
Otherwise you don &apos;t remember who you meet , people like people are , how to remember who was who .
You know what &apos;s we@@ ir@@ d ?
That you and the other r@@ ussi@@ an on here are talking about the chin@@ ese like they &apos;@@ re some sort of unique fascin@@ ation , like they were a zo@@ o ex@@ hibi@@ tion .
And yet you are still dating said white bo@@ y .
How many chin@@ ese men are with white women , compar@@ atively ?
None , because chances are the white parents of such d@@ au@@ ghters will PH@@ Y@@ S@@ ICA@@ L@@ L@@ Y assau@@ lt them .
No measure for imparti@@ ality of justice .
Yet , it is the mother of all bat@@ tles and justice in France remains manipu@@ lated by groups which are very much left-@@ le@@ an@@ ing , such as the magis@@ trates &apos; union ...
@ Mar@@ about : sorry , but the judiciary sectors are frankly right-@@ le@@ an@@ ing .
As for the magis@@ trates &apos; union , it only represents 25 % of judges .
If a measure of its parti@@ ality can be taken from the rela@@ tivity of the enforcement of laws in the courts , it demands two obstacles to be moved away
That of the observer &apos;s political vision and the magis@@ trate &apos;s fac@@ tual interpretation .
It remains then the required tool of the law to re@@ focus the evaluation on the fundamenta@@ ls .
The measu@@ rement of its non-@@ observance in all magis@@ trates &apos; judicial proceedings , including the public prosecutor , forces a distinction to be made between the error and parti@@ ality of magis@@ trates .
It would be in vain to claim that acts of justice are not divided among these three groups .
Pre@@ tension and ignorance do not fall under an objective analysis .
And if therefore all this is not analy@@ zed , how can it be claimed that justice is improving in France ?
If it is only through statistics that impli@@ ci@@ tly reveal that it starts from very low down .
The prece@@ ding preamble makes it possible to include what follows in the third ratio .
That of the corruption * of the magis@@ trates .
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power to cause harm * granted to the judicial institution capable of such he@@ res@@ y .
The field considered is that of the s@@ poli@@ ation * of he@@ irs committed even by means of fraud in the proceeding * by inher@@ it@@ ance gene@@ alo@@ g@@ ists appointed by no@@ tari@@ es .
This professions obta@@ ins , in a good or bad year , 150 million euros while benefiting from the cover * ensured by the virtual judicial impunity * of the French no@@ tari@@ es .
To understand their mechanism , a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication .
Where that joins the aforementioned statistical * improvement moder@@ ated by the prece@@ ding comment is that the judicial institution produced , during the many disputes between gene@@ alo@@ g@@ ists and he@@ irs reluctant to have themselves s@@ poli@@ ated in this way , a whole range of jurisprudence contrary to all the laws in favor of he@@ irs .
Is the presentation of European statistics which ignore this type of rational criteria not then an elabor@@ ate form of lying ?
Ab@@ solu@@ tely awful prices certainly .
More ri@@ p-@@ off equipment for disabled people .
You can say that , but my bro@@ ther has one of the mountain tri@@ kes , built to his dimensions and weight and it has really opened up the out@@ doors in a way that ch@@ un@@ ky whe@@ els and ti@@ res on a normal whe@@ el@@ chair can &apos;t touch .

I &apos;@@ m sure my si@@ ster would love the mountain tri@@ ke but just too expensive .
The ul@@ tra long-@@ distance whe@@ el@@ chair would be good for a disabled person with a han@@ k@@ ering for long@@ boar@@ ding .
We &apos;@@ ve got h@@ ills here that would give them a thri@@ ll .
P@@ ric@@ es do seem high but people D@@ O send that sort of money on a bic@@ ycle , so &quot; y &apos;@@ know &quot; .
I can especially see a case for the M@@ oun@@ tain Tri@@ ke .
Not all disabled people are poor though .
Many have a reasonable insurance pay@@ -@@ out to utili@@ ze .
Only if they became Dis@@ abled .
The fact is that the whe@@ el@@ chair market is a nic@@ he market , so they can afford to charge high prices for things they know we need .

Pri@@ mary and popu@@ list reaction
In fact , we do not know very much about what Mar@@ ine Le Pen thinks .
Where do you get that from ?
Because the Germans refused to pick up any survi@@ v@@ ors .
I &apos;@@ m not sure if Spe@@ e &apos; refused &apos; to pick up survi@@ v@@ ors as such .
One aspect of the battle was that neither side appeared to sure of the exact strength their enemy .
Robert M@@ assi@@ e in his book Cas@@ tles of Steel suggests that Spe@@ e left the area promptly because he had received a report of a British bat@@ t@@ les@@ hi@@ p in the area .
The seas were stor@@ my earlier in the day - not sure whether this was still the case when the battle concluded ?
Equally , combat ended after dark so this would make any rescue operation more difficult .
Contr@@ ast this with the subsequent B@@ attle of the Fal@@ k@@ lands , where pho@@ tos of survi@@ v@@ ors being pic@@ ked up show mil@@ l@@ pon@@ d-@@ like seas and broad da@@ y@@ light .
Moreover , the res@@ cu@@ ers knew there were no more German comba@@ tants in the area by that stage .
H@@ m@@ m , not how I remembered what I had read of the battle so I did a quick wi@@ ki :
There was some confusion amongst the German ships as to the fate of the two arm@@ oured cru@@ is@@ ers , which had disappeared into the dark once they ce@@ ased fir@@ ing , and a hun@@ t began .
L@@ ei@@ p@@ zi@@ g saw something burning , but on approaching found only wrec@@ k@@ age .
N@@ ü@@ r@@ n@@ berg — s@@ lower than the other German ships — arrived late at the battle and sighted Mon@@ mouth , listing and badly damaged but still moving .
After poin@@ tedly dire@@ cting his se@@ arch@@ li@@ ghts at the ship &apos;s en@@ sign , an invitation to sur@@ render — which was decl@@ ined — he opened fire , finally sinking the ship .
Without firm information , von Spe@@ e decided that Good H@@ ope had esca@@ ped and called off the search at 22 : 15 .
Min@@ d@@ ful of the reports that a British bat@@ t@@ les@@ hi@@ p was around somewhere , he turned north .
So if that is accurate the Germans , fu@@ mb@@ ling around in the dark before ra@@ dar , did not know that one ship had sun@@ k , so could not have se@@ ar@@ ched for survi@@ v@@ ors from her .
They also believed that there was a bigger R@@ N bat@@ t@@ les@@ hi@@ p in the area which could have caused them serious damage , so in the confusion they qu@@ it while they were ahead .
They were a long way from home and Spe@@ e was acu@@ tely aware that they had a lot of R@@ N ships to get passed on the way .
C@@ ra@@ dock &apos;s sacrifice had already done them great damage by so@@ aking up about half their am@@ muni@@ tion , do@@ om@@ ing them when they were eventually caught .
Several voices are speaking out in the U@@ M@@ P to ask for it to be written in the law that a definitively sentenced elected representative is definitively in@@ eligible as a result of this fact .
That &apos;s a courageous position , which would also affect elected representatives from the left of course .
But no@@ o@@ o@@ o , it is a jo@@ ke .

When will unions be prohibited in already protected sectors ?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated ?
Main@@ ta@@ ined by political schem@@ ers whose vision of society is limited to these sectors , always quick to sof@@ ten up the same people who will take advantage of their ir@@ remo@@ v@@ ability to hinder the actions of genuine politicians , who really try to get things moving , not the smooth tal@@ kers whose in@@ action is on the same scale as their in@@ adequacy .

She supports the existence of politici@@ zed unions whose members put the enormous power that they have at the service of their party .
She would not defend the same th@@ eses if right-wing unions , even from the extreme right , were choosing figures from their side as their target and were w@@ aging a leg@@ al-@@ media war against them .
Your asser@@ tions are totally gratu@@ it@@ ous .
If the right is currently the main topic in legal developments , this is simply because it has committed acts which per@@ tain to it !
There are no examples of figures from the left who have had so much to do with the Law , but all those who were the object of its attention did not receive preferential treatment .
On the other hand , it must also be recalled that the magis@@ trates &apos; union , which is left-wing , is not the only magis@@ trates &apos; union and that it is a minority .
That a minister should support the unions with such commitment shows to what extent they can be useful .
@ M@@ CR The union which you cite may be a minority among magis@@ trates , but its influence is great in the Chan@@ cer@@ y , this is not a secret .
The question now is if the &quot; mission &quot; of some judges is not more to s@@ me@@ ar rather than investigate .
@ gus - You should be satisfied , the S@@ M is a minority .
What are you compla@@ ining about ?

Very well , but rather than saying that the dru@@ m is lacking sac@@ red@@ ness , is it not better to admit that our Mari@@ ann@@ es and our Mo@@ li@@ ères do not have a little sac@@ red@@ ness either ?
Our bias is like reminded of seeing the sac@@ red as a sort of well-@@ defined object and contained in the religious sphere .
Very interesting article in any case .
It is e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al de@@ co to fill the void .
Nothing more .
Super@@ b article , thank you .
The recent bu@@ rial in the Pan@@ the@@ on of illu@@ stri@@ ous figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sac@@ red sentiment still lives on .
Who still believes the interpretations of ar@@ cha@@ e@@ o@@ log@@ ists !
Any other discipline would cast aside interpretations that are not at all scientific and last the life@@ time of a man@@ dar@@ in , rarely less .
When will there be a comparative criticism of the discipl@@ ines so that we can lau@@ gh a little ?
Because what holds for ar@@ che@@ ology also holds for the interpretations that other discipl@@ ines give .
That would bring a beneficial dose of modes@@ ty .
Your contempt for ar@@ cha@@ e@@ o@@ log@@ ists is absolutely unjustified !
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover tre@@ asures , precious testi@@ monies to rebuild His@@ tory , understand societies , and the example here of comparative ar@@ che@@ ology is exciting .
This method is not very old and before ar@@ cha@@ e@@ o@@ log@@ ists tr@@ usted their &quot; ins@@ tin@@ ct &quot; and their knowledge , and could be mistaken .
N@@ ow@@ adays we have technical and scientific means that are so effective that interpreting ex@@ cav@@ ations is better but can still be called into question by other dis@@ cover@@ ies !
We are right in the middle of ( and an old ) controversy on sha@@ man@@ ism moved forward by the pre@@ histori@@ an Jean C@@ lo@@ ttes ( see his book &quot; The sha@@ mans of pre@@ history &quot; , particularly the re-@@ edi@@ tion increased with scientific controversy , published by La Ma@@ ison des Ro@@ ches edi@@ tions ) .
Thank you for this highly instru@@ ctive article .

No , but we &apos;@@ re not aver@@ se to watching a play about it .

If you &apos;@@ re so off@@ ended by &apos; peu@@ ri@@ le bottom hum@@ our &apos; then you don &apos;t have to participate , do you ?
You do also know that this paper is today covering the Middle East and E@@ bo@@ la and that it &apos;s perfectly possible to do both and publish a piece about an@@ al sex ?
Is it the topic that off@@ ends you , or that people have a lau@@ gh with it ?
Nevertheless , the ama@@ teur vi@@ deo of the cra@@ sh is found on the net ...
ama@@ teur vi@@ deo of the cra@@ sh on the net ... ? ?
If the FO@@ M chose not to show these images , it is only to protect its interests , on no account the driver &apos;s .
If the FO@@ M had wanted to protect the drivers , it would have taken out the safety car at the moment when another vehicle ( breakdown lorry , for example ) entered the circu@@ it .
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the ty@@ pho@@ on , which was known was coming , but for which the FO@@ M did not dee@@ m it appropriate to bring forward the starting time ( television rights , adver@@ ts , money ... ) .
But apart from that they protect the drivers well .
Well read , I also share this opinion .
But also that if the very British FO@@ M makes the SC enter , it is going to enable N@@ ico Ros@@ berg at the res@@ tar@@ t to have a chance of be@@ ating the Eng@@ li@@ sh@@ man , who was leading then ...
Your really let go on this blo@@ g my dear D@@ ay@@ rton .
But it does not matter , I have a little bit of time to flu@@ sh out all your stupi@@ di@@ ties .
No , just no .
There were lo@@ ads of conspi@@ ra@@ cies in F@@ 1 , but never one which puts ste@@ wards in danger of death for a remote story of the possibility of the victory of a driver to the detriment of another .
It is not the FO@@ M that takes out the safety car it is the FI@@ A .
Signi@@ fic@@ ant difference .
In view of ama@@ teur images , the lack of images enables the FI@@ A above all to avoid an@@ no@@ ying questions such as : How is it possible that the ste@@ ward is w@@ aving a green flag mid-@@ operation and continues to do so after the accident ( see the full vi@@ deo after the accident )
No , it is not because the vi@@ deo is deemed too violent that the FI@@ A blocks the images of the accident but because one of the ste@@ wards is clearly seen w@@ aving a green flag , a sign that the race can continue normally and that it is no longer under the control of the y@@ el@@ low flag .
Certain comments show a dark ignorance of F@@ 1 .
Yes dear E@@ tienne , the race is no longer under the control of the y@@ el@@ low flag A@@ F@@ TE@@ R the place of the accident , hence the green flag is flow@@ n .
This is the usual procedure .
The ste@@ wards &apos; post just after the accident ( depending on the case , this can be 10 me@@ ters or 100 me@@ ters after the accident ) is w@@ aving the green to tell the drivers to resume a normal speed .
Sen@@ s@@ ation@@ alism sel@@ ls advertising .
I used to think that the media were an integral part of the government &apos;s &apos; patri@@ o@@ tic &apos; propaganda offensive but I &apos;@@ m afraid that , in the end , it &apos;s just the money .
And sex , lets not forget sex , fear of not getting sex , adver@@ ts and the media are good at selling us things that may lead us to better sex .
The news does the very same thing .
Hy@@ ping things up that the public really don &apos;t need to fret about and that &apos;s all about keeping people sca@@ red so they remain control@@ lable .
&quot; When the tab@@ lo@@ ids cou@@ gh up an E@@ bo@@ la story , we all catch the fear &quot; Should be “ coo@@ k up ” , not “ cou@@ gh up ” .
Given the health con@@ no@@ tations of the word &apos; cou@@ gh &apos; , &apos; cou@@ gh up &apos; is a far more effective turn of phrase than &apos; coo@@ k up &apos; in this context ...
I wonder if all the people y@@ elling that E@@ bo@@ la may become air@@ borne realise they now believe in evolution ?
You are giving them too much credit .
They probably believe that it is the end of the world and e@@ bo@@ la is just one of the signs of the im@@ pending apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se .
E@@ bo@@ la is the Anti-@@ Chris@@ t !
You &apos;@@ re confusing e@@ bo@@ la with mur@@ do@@ ch ..@@ ..
Great article , thanks !
A suc@@ cin@@ ct piece that successfully and soun@@ dly ridi@@ cu@@ les this ab@@ hor@@ rent pseu@@ do journ@@ alism .
That gave me a good lau@@ gh .
It de@@ pres@@ ses me that the media report most things in this reverse positive way .
It is all a part of keeping fear and anxiety levels high enough ( but below hy@@ steri@@ a ) so that the gov@@ t can ti@@ p you over the edge when they need it .
I think it makes perfect sense that if we are to have a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis , a terrorist emergency in the absence in the absence of any acts of terrorism , why not have an e@@ bo@@ la crisis in the absence of any cases ?
This government seems to want to save us from crises of their own invention .
Is there not something intrinsi@@ cally wrong with a fe@@ ar@@ -based approach to government ?
Con@@ gratu@@ lations for this post , and for still being in this world nearly 35 years later .

A perfectly useless testi@@ mony .
Like whenever science is talked about .
Not only do testi@@ monies serve no good : taken on their own , they cannot be used as scientific material .
But they have a damaging influence on the objective appreciation of the facts .
@ trafic : T@@ esti@@ monies cannot be used as scientific material .
This is maybe why one refra@@ ins from posing questions to psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tric patients when one has reliable observations from close relatives .
My psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tric file mentions that my psy@@ chi@@ atr@@ ist mother explains that I was educated tele@@ pa@@ th@@ ically by her mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law .
This is therefore an objective symp@@ tom .
When I say that it is nonsense , it is a subje@@ ctive testi@@ mony without importance .
A@@ h , because the certification of a fact ( = here this testi@@ mony , which proves the contamination and the effectiveness of new treatments ) serves no purpose in a scientific procedure ?
On what do you base your research , then ?
On fanta@@ si@@ es ?
Do you place f@@ anci@@ ful the@@ ories and facts ( = giving rise to veri@@ fiable testi@@ monies ) on the same level ?

Looking forward to this ( even as a grown up ) , but I hope this also inspi@@ res one of the channels to re-@@ run the origin@@ als .
It &apos;s virtually never been off the air here in Australia - for at least the last 40 years , we &apos;@@ ve had h@@ our@@ -@@ long episo@@ des on Satur@@ days &amp; Sun@@ days at 0@@ 600 .
Since the ad@@ vent of digital free@@ -to-@@ air TV a few years ago , it has been moved to one of the secondary commercial channels &amp; still scre@@ ens at those times .
The bon@@ us is that half-@@ hour episo@@ des are now on at 0@@ 5@@ 30 , Monday to Friday !
Yes , I am probably a &quot; sad &quot; 60 year old blo@@ ke , but I don &apos;t watch it every day !
There is no &quot; T@@ emp@@ le M@@ ount &quot; in or under the es@@ plan@@ ade of mos@@ ques ! ! !
Ra@@ dical Z@@ ion@@ ists inven@@ ted it to give themselves political legitimacy to coloni@@ ze Jerusalem .
Moreover , all the Israeli ex@@ cav@@ ations under@@ ne@@ ath and around the es@@ plan@@ ade of mos@@ ques for several decades have not been able to find anything .
The temp@@ le moun@@ t , if it exists , it is elsewhere .
Perhaps in Argentina ?
This moun@@ t is not looked for due to the simple reason that it is the h@@ ill on which the es@@ plan@@ ade of mos@@ ques was built .
Its summit , or the dome of the R@@ oc@@ k , ju@@ ts out in the middle of the O@@ mar mos@@ que .
For Muslims , Mo@@ ham@@ med went up to heav@@ en from this ro@@ ck .
For Jews , it is the moun@@ t M@@ ori@@ ah where A@@ bra@@ ham almost sacrificed his son I@@ sa@@ a@@ c .
From the moment when it was taken and con@@ tex@@ tu@@ aliz@@ ed , there is no propaganda , but information , dear K@@ 1@@ K@@ 1 .
Israel also has its extremists , it is good to remember that regularly , and they unfortunately took over in the government ( N@@ af@@ tal@@ i B@@ enn@@ et , A@@ vig@@ dor Li@@ e@@ ber@@ mann , and even Ne@@ tan@@ y@@ ah@@ ou , the latter had accepted the 2-@@ state plan , and scrap@@ ped it continually ! ) .
It is also to show to what extent the annex@@ ation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful event .

To praise tourism in Israel to us , we are often shown half-@@ un@@ dres@@ sed young n@@ y@@ mp@@ hs , langu@@ id on the be@@ ach .
The reality is , as usually , quite different from what the adver@@ ti@@ sement shows us , as can be seen on the pho@@ to which illustrates the article .
It is a bit scar@@ y all the same .
And this pho@@ to is a magnificent propaganda campaign !
Sha@@ me that the Re@@ u@@ ters photo@@ graph@@ er did not take a pho@@ to of the hundreds of Palestinians auth@@ ori@@ zed to go back to the temp@@ le M@@ ount and who prefer to stone faith@@ ful Jews down below , pra@@ ying at the wa@@ iling Wall .
@ M@@ at , If this pho@@ to distur@@ bs you , it has every right to do so , it is neither the newspaper , nor the photo@@ graph@@ er , but this woman and the ideology that she trans@@ mits that must be condemned .
This is not sustainable and will end in te@@ ars .
The only way to end it is revolution .
Since the economy apparently went to sh@@ it big business has hu@@ gely taken advantage of their employees .
They have managed to convince their workers that they are lu@@ ck@@ y to have a job and that they can &apos;t afford to be given pay rises , whilst at the same time and in plain sight , they have awarded the elite few at the top bigger and bigger re@@ wards .
You are right it is not sustainable , but it will only end in this country when the working classes actually speak with one voice .
Rather than bit@@ ch and mo@@ an about somebody else &apos;s industrial action , support it , show a bit of solidarity and recognise that their action is not only dealing with their issues , but is also showing your employer there are consequences for taking the pis@@ s .
Not if we get rid of democracy , then it is sustainable .
I totally agree .
The only point you missed was how UK and US business sold our manufacturing and now our service jobs off to countries with the worst , most polluting places with cheap@@ est most exploited workers .
China and India come to mind .
There is no way this is going to end well .
It &apos;s because we don &apos;t have democracy that it has been sustained .

The next weak spot is likely to be the car market .
This man is right , in the 18@@ th there were unions in all the regi@@ ments
In the very Catholic French army , there is a sacri@@ ficial dimension .
Le@@ a@@ ve it ( well , its officers , the others , no one knows anything ) to believe that it is the safe of France &apos;s e@@ ternal values , and it will fight and shut up .
And then with the decline of the country , glob@@ aliz@@ ation , Europe , the crisis of values , in short : the dis@@ solution of the idea of the N@@ ation , to have this small reli@@ c , it &apos;s comfor@@ ting .
Even if for it , it is more and more un@@ comfortable ...
You are still missing the union of married men , single men , married women , single women , lost do@@ gs and I don &apos;t know what else
If you do not write French correctly , I &apos;@@ ll form a union .
You have been warned , it will be your fault .
For the defence of interest groups , we already have to put up with protected professions equipped with unions quite enough , which created a breach of equality with other citizens .
We are requested not to lau@@ gh about a civil servant &apos;s fear of risk .
One can very easily imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions , or without the right to strike like in Germany , in exchange for the protection which they enjoy .
Otherwise catastrophe is ensured .
And with the char@@ re@@ ttes which are prepared , the government congratu@@ lates itself .
What security are you talking about ?
Ign@@ or@@ ance indeed ...
Ign@@ or@@ ance for ignorance . Sy@@ b@@ ille I was referring to soldiers and other civil servants , as this is the subject commented on here ...

R@@ oll on G@@ B@@ B@@ O@@ 15 !
I@@ d agree , last years final challenge , the we@@ d@@ ding ca@@ ke , was lu@@ dic@@ rous .
Profes@@ sion@@ als usually take days to make them and they were expected to kno@@ ck one together in 3-@@ 4 hours .
The three show@@ stop@@ pers were all so ne@@ ck and ne@@ ck I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;t imagine how they &apos;@@ d pick a winner .
Lu@@ is &apos; bottom la@@ yer being a bit dry was the only real fault they found ( though I agreed with Hol@@ ly@@ wood that the li@@ me green icing on Richard &apos;s win@@ d@@ m@@ ill was a bit off putting , though Richard had already blow@@ n it by that point ) .
I must admit , several of the challenges in this series have felt a bit artificial because of the time restrictions .
There is also cancer which lies in wait , with the gus@@ ts of so@@ lar wind .
We are certainly succe@@ eding at everything at the moment .
A bad moment for humanity to go through is expected .
You are mix@@ ing so@@ lar wind and ultra@@ vio@@ let ra@@ ys up .
U@@ V ra@@ ys are mainly blocked by the ozone la@@ yer , which is formed precisely by the impact of residu@@ al so@@ lar wind par@@ ticles and U@@ V ra@@ ys .
So , even if the mag@@ ne@@ tic field gets weaker , there would not be enough so@@ lar wind to &quot; get rid of &quot; the stra@@ to@@ s@@ ph@@ eric ozone .
There would be even more , and therefore less U@@ V and &quot; can@@ cers &quot; .
Fortunately the ozone la@@ yer does not block U@@ V ra@@ ys .
They have lo@@ ads of useful functions that you cannot even imagine .
If we limit ourselves to man , they are concerned with allowing us to have b@@ ones ( syn@@ thesis of vi@@ tam@@ in D ) , he@@ ating us ( apart from infra@@ red ) , modu@@ lating our imm@@ une system and , it seems , improving our morale .
The ozone la@@ yer blocks the carcino@@ genic U@@ VC and lets U@@ VA and the majority of U@@ V@@ B through .
Do you know that you are not obliged to be con@@ descen@@ ding and to consider your interlocutor as a back@@ ward person when you post a comment ?
Above all for a minor clarification which was impli@@ ed in the comment , which itself intends to show pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy .
Without saying that I know mel@@ anom@@ as well , U@@ V ra@@ ys only AC@@ CE@@ LE@@ R@@ AT@@ E their development .
They do not CA@@ US@@ E them .
As proof : all tan@@ ned people do not necessarily have mel@@ anom@@ as .
That is to say , when a doctor tells you that it is necessary to avoid the su@@ n and live at the bottom of a cel@@ lar , it is better not to listen as U@@ V ra@@ ys are necessary for every human .
Ex@@ cess , on the other hand , is like everything : it k@@ ills .

It &apos;s quite difficult to see how a pro@@ to@@ type could get anywhere near the distribution operation .
By the time the special software is being instal@@ led , you would think the phone would be clear of the main production line , and it &apos;s difficult to imagine how it would get back into it .

More likely it is a production unit that has@@ n &apos;t had the i@@ O@@ S software instal@@ led correctly and is stuck with the factory test code instal@@ led .
I have no idea how they make these things .
Would they have test software on every single one , though ?

O@@ K then no hard feelings , I send you a k@@ iss
We call bo@@ h@@ os , or rather eco-@@ bo@@ h@@ os , people who see the world through an ideological &quot; software progra@@ m &quot; , which leads them to dis@@ conne@@ ct themselves from realities .
It is the full un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling of thou@@ ght-@@ reason .
They are experts in gesti@@ cu@@ lation , for example they claim to save the planet because they avoided having a show@@ er .
They are also experts in hypocrisy , agreeing with the ca@@ vi@@ ar left , from which they sometimes come , for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holi@@ days in the Mal@@ di@@ ves .
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not put up with this mix@@ ture of o@@ af@@ ish ideology and hypocrisy , therefore do not be surprised if you often find criticisms on them .
W@@ ow , thank for this complete and exhaustive the@@ ori@@ z@@ ation and for all the associated details ( plane , show@@ er ... ) .
I would really like to be a part of them , but I cannot find my way around them .
The concept is not that complicated .
The eco-@@ bo@@ h@@ os are cast in one piece .
Di@@ d you understand the concept of the ca@@ vi@@ ar left ?
Well then , you are in a position to understand the eco-@@ bo@@ ho concept .
It is a perfect copy with just an ideological nu@@ ance .
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in eco@@ log@@ ists full stop .
The eco-@@ bo@@ ho is part of it , but only represents the most visible fr@@ in@@ ge of eco@@ log@@ ists , as it is this one which inf@@ ests the media .
You are ha@@ v@@ in &apos; a gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .

The fact that Em@@ in can &apos;t draw and seems ob@@ ses@@ sed with the same subject matter is not the point .
The point is , she actually managed to make herself fab@@ ul@@ ously wealthy and famous on the back of no arti@@ stic ability .
That &apos;s * art * .
That &apos;s F@@ AR@@ T
The fact that Em@@ in can &apos;t draw
Not really a fact that one .
More of an opinion .
Unless you are only capable of appreci@@ ating life@@ like recre@@ ations of smoking do@@ gs playing pool .
There can be a problem with the institution of art appreciation but not in this case .
D@@ ra@@ wing encom@@ passes more than mere representation .
If that is all you want then a cam@@ era will do .

Have another look and let the picture speak for itself - not as a comparison to the type of drawing that you perhaps prefer .
If it &apos;s so easy , why don &apos;t you do it ?
There are still things to economi@@ ze on : hor@@ se-@@ ri@@ ding activities , the number of re@@ publi@@ can guard hor@@ ses or the status of gener@@ als who are no longer in active service ...

Where is the promised enshr@@ inement ?

This is exactly what you suggest doing , look elsewhere where chaos is certain .
Let all those who mixed more or less with the military thing dare to come and say here , face to face , that there is no money wasted in this area and without bur@@ sting out lau@@ gh@@ ing ...

And for Jo@@ si : really irri@@ tating : look at the inf@@ lated public jobs in the other minis@@ tries and you will understand why Defence may regard itself as a little full !

How will closing the V@@ al de Gra@@ ce weaken our defence tool in the Sa@@ h@@ el ?
As for the local communities , history repe@@ ats itself with each post , maternity , hospital , bar@@ ra@@ cks closure .
But everyone is for economies of course .
It is strange , a U@@ M@@ P mayor who wants to offset and is not delighted with the economies made in public spending .
This is literally the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling article I have ever read !
That aw@@ k@@ ward moment when the first three commen@@ ters make the same bad jo@@ ke .
That life s@@ ap@@ ping moment when you s@@ cro@@ ll down your F@@ ace@@ book feed and learn that 80 % of your friends have started their posts with the phrase &quot; That aw@@ k@@ ward moment &quot; .
I gather there &apos;s now a film with that title .
It probably reli@@ es on h@@ il@@ arious scenes involving people bu@@ mping into their ex &apos;s on the bus and getting to work only to discover they have tu@@ cked their sk@@ ir@@ t into their p@@ ants .
That &apos;s not fu@@ cking aw@@ k@@ ward , it &apos;s bra@@ in-de@@ ad .
Not really , to me it sounds like the writ@@ er is playing the role of the usual British male brought up to down@@ play emo@@ tions and bi@@ te the li@@ p .
I &apos;@@ m sure if you &apos;@@ re a K@@ ate Bush f@@ an , her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been an emotional event .
You realise your post is now being fought over , to be op@@ tioned ?
I don &apos;t have the &quot; internet &quot; .
So I don &apos;t feel that I can comment .
Not having a computer .
OMG , if I don &apos;t see that I am going to die !
I cannot believe just how min@@ d-@@ blow@@ ingly aw@@ es@@ ome this article is !
Char@@ lie has truly proved that he is at the very ape@@ x of the ste@@ l@@ lar univer@@ se that is s@@ ati@@ ric@@ al journ@@ alism !
I sw@@ o@@ on at his feet !
Now I have to share this to all my follow@@ ers and friends on F@@ ace@@ book and T@@ wit@@ ter and enli@@ ghten them as to the fantas@@ tically inestima@@ ble and im@@ measu@@ rably u@@ tter brilli@@ ance that eman@@ ates like a div@@ ine g@@ low from Mr Bro@@ o@@ ker &apos;s ke@@ y@@ board .
God it was cra@@ p .
Especially when they are neither women , nor trans@@ v@@ esti@@ tes .
I am a par@@ asi@@ te .
This shows a positive evolution within democracies : the rise of regional policies and effective community initiatives .
Until further notice we make ourselves take away the right to save our planet by States who play the hypo@@ crites at each meeting to save the planet .
We decide therefore , citizens , to take control of things .
With the commission@@ er who they plan@@ ted in energy , all these fine recommendations van@@ ished ...
You translate : W@@ ind tur@@ b@@ ines and so@@ lar farms are the roun@@ d@@ abou@@ ts of tomorrow .
Everything funded by the taxpayer .
I beg you to stop this pro-@@ nuclear dis@@ course .
Pol@@ lu@@ tion is not limited to CO2 .
Radi@@ o@@ activity is much more harmful with respect to its waste and in the event of an accident .
As the industry is not controlled in its entirety , it is better to limit it to laboratories .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energies are our only salv@@ ation , provided of course that our consumption is drastically reduced .
Elec@@ tri@@ city with renew@@ ables to combat CO2 emissions ?
France is not concerned at all .
Nuclear electricity means zero CO2 emissions during production and ep@@ sil@@ on for the other stages .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able wind or P@@ V electricity already means more G@@ H@@ G@@ s in the other stages and above all gas , or worse , coal , like in Germany , to compensate for the inter@@ mit@@ ten@@ ce .
Re@@ placing nuclear with renewable wind or P@@ V would run counter to the fight against CO2 .
Chris@@ tial , I am not insul@@ ting you . I have a State D@@ oc@@ torate in physical sciences 198@@ 1 . In addition , I &apos;@@ ve done research on nuclear physi@@ cs , I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said .
For what I did not say , it is you who len@@ ds me ideas . I did not say anything about Germany , nothing at all in fact . You have not replied to what I was saying and like all right-@@ w@@ ing@@ ers I never destroy the interlocutor .
I quote furthermore the conclusion of experts appointed by the German government : Germany &apos;s current renewable energy programme is a non-@@ profitable and ineffective means to reduce G@@ H@@ G emissions and should be stopped .
0 emission if you do not count uranium extr@@ action and construction and if you do not count the water va@@ por greenhouse gas with less of an effect than CO2 . It is true , reminder : two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear plant leaves as water va@@ por and a little in the water of rivers .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t read after you referred Pakistan as &quot; SO@@ U@@ T@@ H A@@ S@@ I@@ AN G@@ I@@ A@@ N@@ T &quot; ... ! !
Pakistan won the last football series against H@@ indus@@ tan .
Y@@ e@@ ah why would you , most Indian Com@@ men@@ ters just want to read and comment on something that &apos;s against Pakistan .
S@@ how@@ s your mentality by the way .
Would have done the same thing if they called India as South Asian Gi@@ ant ...
I have no issues with individual Pakistan@@ i players playing but a Pakistan@@ i franchise is a strict no-@@ no .
It would just open a pan@@ dora &apos;s box of corruption and under@@ world influ@@ ences
As for the IS@@ L , today &apos;s opening match was a surpris@@ ingly enter@@ taining affair with Ath@@ le@@ tico de K@@ olk@@ ata winning 3-@@ 0 against Mu@@ m@@ ba@@ i .
Pakistan has a very very long way to go .
Compar@@ ing it to the vas@@ ts billions India spen@@ ds on the IP@@ L c@@ ric@@ ket and now the football , how are we ever going to compete with our &quot; nois@@ y neighbours &quot; ..@@ ..
The flight on the low-@@ cost laun@@ cher is paid in cash .
A shame for such a fine project .
For the incident , the potential design f@@ law only shows itself with he@@ li@@ um that is too cold .
It is perhaps not a f@@ law in the design , but in the implementation ...
contrary to ari@@ an@@ espace , which is a private company , it seems that so@@ y@@ ou@@ z belongs to the Russian state ...
And if the rule is the same as here , the state is its own insu@@ rer ...
They are going to perhaps pay for the satellites in fri@@ ga@@ tes , who knows ..
That is all the more regrettable since a lot of the media constantly go back over only the ti@@ tles of articles - and that many read@@ ers only remember the ti@@ tles .
All in all that creates an erron@@ eous impression contrary to the content of the article itself .
To@@ tally in agreement with you , the title is not appropriate , it un@@ jus@@ tly calls into question the project , while it is only a problem with the laun@@ cher .
