S@@ pec@@ ta@@ cular W@@ ing@@ suit Ju@@ mp Over Bo@@ go@@ ta
S@@ port@@ sman J@@ hon@@ a@@ than F@@ lo@@ rez ju@@ mped from a he@@ licop@@ ter above Bo@@ go@@ ta , the capital of Colombia , on Thursday .
W@@ earing a w@@ ing@@ suit , he fle@@ w past over the famous Mon@@ ser@@ rate San@@ ctu@@ ary at 16@@ 0@@ km / h . The san@@ ctu@@ ary is located at an al@@ titude of over 3@@ 000 me@@ ters and numerous specta@@ tors had gathered there to watch his exploit .
A black box in your car ?
As America &apos;s road plan@@ ners struggle to find the cash to men@@ d a cru@@ mb@@ ling high@@ way system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits ne@@ at@@ ly by the da@@ sh@@ board of your car .
The devices , which track every mile a motor@@ ist dri@@ ves and trans@@ mit that information to bureaucra@@ ts , are at the cen@@ ter of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America &apos;s major roads .
The usually du@@ ll arena of high@@ way planning has suddenly spa@@ w@@ ned intense debate and col@@ or@@ ful alliances .
Liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
The te@@ a party is ag@@ ha@@ st .
The American Civil Liber@@ ties Union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
And while Congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
They are expl@@ oring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
Th@@ ou@@ sands of motor@@ ists have already taken the black boxes , some of which have GPS monitoring , for a test drive .
This really is a must for our nation .
&quot; It is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said H@@ as@@ an I@@ k@@ h@@ ra@@ ta , executive director of the Southern C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia As@@ s@@ n@@ . of Governments , which is planning for the state to start trac@@ king miles driven by every C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia motor@@ ist by 20@@ 25 .
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do it .
The push comes as the country &apos;s High@@ way T@@ rust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pu@@ mp , is broke .
Americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to .
C@@ ars get many more miles to the gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , 18@@ .@@ 4 cents per gall@@ on , has@@ n &apos;t gone up in 20 years .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one pen@@ ny when gas prices are high .
&quot; The gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said Le@@ e Mun@@ n@@ ich , a transportation policy expert at the University of Min@@ nes@@ o@@ ta .
His state recently put trac@@ king devices on 500 cars to test out a pay@@ -@@ by-@@ mile system .
&quot; This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
W@@ on@@ ks call it a mi@@ le@@ ag@@ e-@@ based user fe@@ e .
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liber@@ als , as the taxes could be ri@@ gged to change driving pat@@ ter@@ ns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example .
C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia plan@@ ners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
But Re@@ p@@ . Bill Sh@@ uster ( R@@ -@@ P@@ a . ) , chairman of the House Trans@@ por@@ tation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .
The free marke@@ teers at the Re@@ as@@ on Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile .
&quot; This is not just a tax going into a black ho@@ le , &quot; said A@@ dri@@ an Mo@@ ore , vice president of policy at Re@@ as@@ on .
People are paying more directly into what they are getting .
The movement is also bol@@ ste@@ red by two former U@@ .@@ S@@ . Trans@@ por@@ tation secre@@ tari@@ es , who in a 20@@ 11 report urged Congress to move in the pay@@ -@@ per@@ -@@ mile direction .
The U@@ .@@ S@@ . Sen@@ ate approved a $ 9@@ 0-@@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10@@ ,@@ 000 cars .
But the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve log@@ ging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
The most e@@ ager is O@@ reg@@ on , which is en@@ listing 5@@ ,@@ 000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .
Those drivers will soon pay the mi@@ le@@ age fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilot .
New York City is looking into one .
Il@@ lin@@ ois is trying it on a limited basis with tru@@ cks .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 Co@@ ali@@ tion , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Se@@ abo@@ ard ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In N@@ ev@@ ada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were un@@ easy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
&quot; Concer@@ ns about Bi@@ g Bro@@ ther and those sorts of things were a major problem , &quot; said A@@ lau@@ dd@@ in K@@ han , who directs strategic and performance management at the N@@ ev@@ ada De@@ part@@ ment of Trans@@ por@@ tation .
It was not something people wanted .
As the trial got underway , the AC@@ L@@ U of N@@ ev@@ ada warned on its website : &quot; It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-@@ fledged trac@@ king devices . &quot;
There is no need to build an enormous , un@@ wiel@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and go@@ ings .
N@@ ev@@ ada is among several states now scra@@ mb@@ ling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
If you can do that , K@@ han said , the public gets more comfortable .
The hun@@ t for that technology has led some state agencies to a small C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia star@@ tu@@ p called T@@ rue Mi@@ le@@ age .
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in au@@ to insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mi@@ le@@ age .
But the devices it is testing appeal to high@@ way plan@@ ners because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , u@@ plo@@ aded perio@@ dic@@ ally by mode@@ m .
&quot; People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said R@@ yan Mor@@ ris@@ on , chief executive of T@@ rue Mi@@ le@@ age .
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot progra@@ ms .
There are a lot less expensive and less intru@@ sive ways to do this .
In O@@ reg@@ on , plan@@ ners are experi@@ menting with giving drivers different choices .
They can choose a dev@@ ice with or without GPS .
Or they can choose not to have a dev@@ ice at all , opting instead to pay a fl@@ at fe@@ e based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a w@@ ary public by having the devices do more , not less .
In New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing dev@@ ice that would also be equipped to pay par@@ king me@@ ter fees , provide &quot; pay@@ -@@ as@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of re@@ al-@@ time speed data from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; M@@ otor@@ ists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .
Some transportation plan@@ ners , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a gi@@ ant dis@@ tr@@ action .
At the Me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan Trans@@ por@@ tation Commission in the San Fran@@ cis@@ co Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrup@@ t High@@ way T@@ rust Fund by raising gas taxes .
An extra one-@@ time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hy@@ bri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; There is no need for radical sur@@ ger@@ y when all you need to do is take an aspi@@ r@@ in , &quot; said R@@ an@@ dy R@@ ent@@ s@@ ch@@ ler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .
If we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .
David Bo@@ wi@@ e : Four Un@@ published S@@ on@@ gs Re@@ le@@ ased
The British musi@@ cian is full of sur@@ prises this year .
Following The Next Day , released in January , he has put together a de@@ lux@@ e re-@@ release planned for November 04 , fea@@ turing several un@@ published trac@@ ks .
Four have already appeared on the Internet .
The announcement that David Bo@@ wi@@ e was rele@@ asing a new al@@ bu@@ m had st@@ un@@ ned the world .
On 08 January 2013 , the date of his 6@@ 6@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , he announced that a new al@@ bu@@ m would be released in March .
After ten years of silence ( his last record , Re@@ ality , was released in 2003 ) and very few public appearances , the British musi@@ cian proved that he could still light up the po@@ p scene .
A fe@@ ast for f@@ ans
Not tired of making sur@@ prises , David Bo@@ wi@@ e had more than one tric@@ k up his sle@@ eves with The Next Day :
the Th@@ in White Du@@ ke was also planning to re-@@ release the al@@ bu@@ m on November 04 .
He put together a real fe@@ ast for his f@@ ans to mark the occasion .
This re-@@ release , ti@@ tled The Next Day Ex@@ tra , was presented in the form of three dis@@ ks : the original al@@ bu@@ m , un@@ published stu@@ dio sessions and re@@ mix@@ es , plus a D@@ VD containing the four cli@@ ps that have already been un@@ ve@@ iled .
The Next Day Ex@@ tra had a total of ten additional trac@@ ks compared to the original al@@ bu@@ m : the three son@@ gs from the Del@@ ux@@ e edi@@ tion , five son@@ gs speci@@ ally un@@ ve@@ iled for the occasion , and two re@@ mix@@ es .
Moreover , David Bo@@ wi@@ e has introduced this fine bo@@ x-@@ set through a vi@@ deo .
In it , he presents each of the dis@@ ks plus the ac@@ cess@@ ories provided with them : exclusive pho@@ tos and sle@@ eves , a no@@ te@@ book for sharing your own impres@@ sions , a boo@@ k@@ let of ly@@ ric@@ s etc .
And finally , he gives a te@@ as@@ er to his new track , Atom@@ ica , which is ty@@ pic@@ ally in the style of The Next Day , with very prominent gu@@ it@@ ars and sk@@ ill@@ fully controlled ro@@ ck elec@@ tric@@ s .
Pre@@ vi@@ ously Un@@ published Tra@@ cks Re@@ le@@ ased
However , Atom@@ ica is not the only track to have been released .
The In@@ former , Like A R@@ oc@@ ket M@@ an and Bor@@ n In A U@@ F@@ O are also available on the net .
The In@@ former is dou@@ ble-@@ ed@@ ged - an un@@ sett@@ ling in@@ tro followed by a brilli@@ ant rush of sound that progressively slow@@ s down to make way for a po@@ p bal@@ la@@ d .
W@@ as Bo@@ wi@@ e trying to make a reference to El@@ ton John &apos;s R@@ oc@@ ket M@@ an , or even Gra@@ vity , in his Like A R@@ oc@@ ket M@@ an ?
Either way , with this che@@ er@@ ful track , the sing@@ er seems to be in his element when his feet are no longer on the ground .
Space O@@ d@@ dity , by comparison , was much more sole@@ mn .
On Bor@@ n in a U@@ F@@ O , David Bo@@ wi@@ e once again refers to his stran@@ gen@@ ess : could he have come from another planet ?
The spe@@ ll@@ binding gui@@ tar ri@@ ffs make you want to leave Ear@@ th .
In any case , Bo@@ wi@@ e enjoys playing the cha@@ me@@ le@@ on in these trac@@ ks : in turn , an informer , a ro@@ cket man , possibly a Mar@@ tian ...
He ve@@ ils and reveals at the same time , and likes to take on different person@@ alities , as he has throughout his career , most notably with his personas : Z@@ ig@@ gy S@@ tar@@ d@@ ust and A@@ la@@ dd@@ in San@@ e .
It is therefore not surprising that he should be holding a mas@@ k in the promo@@ tional photo@@ graphy for L &apos;@@ In@@ vi@@ tation au Vo@@ yage , by Louis V@@ u@@ it@@ ton , of which he is the new face .
He appears in one of their adver@@ ts , broadcast from November 10 .
The Minister of Defence , Ro@@ b Nicholson , insisted that injured soldiers are not sum@@ marily dis@@ charged from the Canadian Ar@@ med For@@ ces and stressed that all soldiers undergo a transition process before their return to civilian life .
At@@ ta@@ cked by liber@@ als and neo-@@ democrats in the House of Comm@@ ons , M@@ r. Nicholson assured that , prior to their discharge , members of the army under@@ went a transition plan in collaboration with their superi@@ ors .
&quot; All injured soldiers receive the appropriate care in preparation for their return to civilian life and none has been dis@@ charged before being ready , &quot; he asser@@ ted .
