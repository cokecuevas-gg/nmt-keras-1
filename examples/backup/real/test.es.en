A Re@@ publi@@ can strategy to counter the re-@@ election of Ob@@ ama
Re@@ publi@@ can leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Bren@@ n@@ an Centre considers this a my@@ th , stating that electoral fraud is ra@@ rer in the United States than the number of people killed by li@@ ght@@ ning .
Indeed , Re@@ publi@@ can lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Re@@ publi@@ can representatives added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 b@@ ills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 20@@ 11 alone .
The new election laws require voters to show a pho@@ to I@@ D card and proof of US citizenship .
Furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invali@@ date the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
Before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a pho@@ to I@@ D card .
Indi@@ ana was the first State to impose such a requirement .
In 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitu@@ tionality of the Indi@@ ana law .
The Re@@ publi@@ can authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States .
Over the past two years , they spon@@ so@@ red b@@ ills in 34 States to force voters to show a pho@@ to I@@ D card .
It is important to note that , unlike Que@@ be@@ c , American citizens do not have a universal I@@ D card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a pho@@ to I@@ D card issued by a government agency of their State .
In addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
The new restrictions dis@@ proportion@@ ately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
In fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those ear@@ ning less than $ 3@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required pho@@ to I@@ D card .
And that &apos;s not all .
Stu@@ dents , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the pho@@ to I@@ D card issued by their institution .
On the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Re@@ publi@@ can , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
Pri@@ or to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Ari@@ zona was the first to introduce such a requirement .
Since 20@@ 11 , a do@@ zen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the His@@ panic vote .
However , it appears that two out of three His@@ panic voters favour the Democratic party .
What is more , in 20@@ 11 Re@@ publi@@ can legislators spon@@ so@@ red laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States .
In addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
These restrictions are not without consequence .
For example , during the 2004 general election , voter registration campaigns contributed to regis@@ tering around 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Re@@ publi@@ can legislators have en@@ acted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
For example , during the 2008 general election in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , 33 % of early voters were Afric@@ an-@@ Americans , who accoun@@ ted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
The same applied to His@@ pan@@ ics .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
On the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
Of course , Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration .
Several b@@ ills were blocked by ve@@ to@@ es of Democratic govern@@ ors .
The United States At@@ tor@@ ney General interven@@ ed to suspend the most controversial laws .
They were able to partially limit the damage .
For example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a pho@@ to I@@ D card .
However , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influen@@ cing the 2012 results in key States .
A 20@@ 11 Bren@@ n@@ an Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency .
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Pro@@ state cancer screening : take the test or not ?
Indeed , the P@@ SA test sometimes shows erron@@ eous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
E@@ nou@@ gh to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests .
Take the test or not ?
We asked two specialists for their opinion .
In studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations .
Another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were scre@@ ened and those who were not .
This study also showed , with a follow-up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for me@@ ta@@ sta@@ ses to occur in the absence of screening .
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had pro@@ state cancer .
Afric@@ an-@@ American men are also more at risk .
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
There are aggressive can@@ cers and others that are in@@ do@@ lent .
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating pro@@ state can@@ cers that are not long-term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
Today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
A@@ ctive monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progres@@ ses , they will be offered treatment .
More and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
Therefore I recommend taking the test .
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
In collaboration with the Soci@@ été internationale d &apos;@@ uro@@ logie &#91; S@@ I@@ U &#93; , Mo@@ v@@ ember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pro@@ s and con@@ s of the P@@ SA test .
You can down@@ load the document ( in English for the time being , a &#91; French &#93; translation will be available shortly ) at this address : h@@ tt@@ p : / / ca@@ .@@ mo@@ v@@ emb@@ er@@ .@@ com / f@@ r / men@@ s-@@ health / pro@@ state-@@ can@@ cer@@ -@@ screening
Pre@@ ven@@ ting the disease
Unfortunately , there is no miracle reci@@ pe for preventing cancer .
Despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough , 30 % of can@@ cers could be prevented .
&quot; If no more people smo@@ ked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , &quot; says An@@ dré Beau@@ lieu , spokesman for the Canadian Can@@ cer Society .
On the other hand , it is estimated that rou@@ ghly 10 % of can@@ cers are he@@ redi@@ tary .
Some are also completely un@@ explained .
For the Canadian Can@@ cer Society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smo@@ kers .
C@@ ig@@ are@@ ttes are linked to 85 % of l@@ ung cancer cases .
It is also a risk factor for a number of others .
This massi@@ vely damages people &apos;s health .
&quot; Even today , there are 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Que@@ be@@ c &quot; deplo@@ res spo@@ k@@ esper@@ son An@@ dré Beau@@ lieu .
En@@ coura@@ ging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer dro@@ ps by half .
W@@ eight
Over@@ weight and obe@@ sity are also conducive to the on@@ set of the disease , according to the S@@ C@@ C .
They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , col@@ on and rec@@ tu@@ m , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gus , pan@@ cre@@ as and u@@ ter@@ us .
&quot; Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against col@@ on cancer &quot; it is also said .
Di@@ et
The organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat .
In large amounts , it increases the risks of developing colo@@ -@@ rec@@ tal cancer .
Li@@ ke@@ wise , so do cu@@ red meat products , and these should be avoided .
The conservation of meat by smoking , dr@@ ying or curing can cause the formation of carcino@@ gens .
&quot; They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer &quot; it is explained .
Vi@@ ta@@ min@@ s
In recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vi@@ tam@@ in supplements and cancer .
For the time being however their research is in@@ conclu@@ sive .
Stu@@ dies on vi@@ tam@@ in E are contradictory , according to the S@@ C@@ C .
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of pro@@ state cancer , another noted an increase .
Also the effect of vi@@ tam@@ in D on cancer is not clear .
In addition , Mr Beau@@ lieu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
&quot; Taking a screening test do@@ es@@ n &apos;t give you cancer . &quot;
The H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son revealed
The announcement of the probable disco@@ very of the H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son created quite a stir last summer , and with good reason .
Indeed , it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Uni@@ verse , no less .
Also it is the last par@@ ticle whose existence is predic@@ ted by the Stand@@ ard Mo@@ del - our best or &quot; less worse &quot; explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed emp@@ ir@@ ically .
But for physi@@ cis@@ ts , it is still not completely sure that it really is the H@@ ig@@ gs .
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authenti@@ c par@@ ticle , and greatly re@@ semb@@ les the H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son predic@@ ted by the Stand@@ ard Mo@@ del .
In addition , new data un@@ ve@@ iled this week at a large physi@@ cs Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
But let &apos;s suppose that it really is the H@@ ig@@ gs , since the chances of being mistaken seem sli@@ m , and see what it is .
In our world , there is a fa@@ tally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time .
There &apos;s no way to break this rule - and don &apos;t try too hard , you &apos;@@ ll go mad .
However , even though par@@ ticle physi@@ cs is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Pau@@ li exclusion principle , which states that two par@@ ticles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot; qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m state &quot; - this &quot; state &quot; consisting rou@@ ghly of certain of their characteristics .
B@@ ased on this , physi@@ cis@@ ts classi@@ fy par@@ ticles into two categories .
In one corner we have good citizens called fer@@ mi@@ ons , who wis@@ ely obe@@ y the Pau@@ li principle .
While lu@@ r@@ king in the other are the bo@@ sons , a n@@ as@@ ty band of an@@ arch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
These bo@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Ber@@ ke@@ ley Lab@@ s Par@@ ticle Ad@@ venture site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mes@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and &quot; force par@@ ticles &quot; by which the great forces of nature are propag@@ ated and to which the H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son may be somehow related .
These bo@@ sons , it must be stressed here , are not all such exo@@ tic bu@@ gs as you might think .
In fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordinarily ban@@ al bo@@ son : the ph@@ ot@@ on , or the &quot; light par@@ ticle &quot; which is the &quot; mes@@ sen@@ ger &quot; of the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force .
When , in fact , a par@@ ticle having an electri@@ c charge acceler@@ ates or changes direction , this &quot; distur@@ bs &quot; the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field in this specific place , rather like a pe@@ b@@ ble thrown in a pon@@ d .
This &quot; distur@@ b@@ ance &quot; produces an elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic wave ( of light , infra@@ red , ultra@@ vio@@ let etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a ph@@ ot@@ on - and thus one of the &quot; force carri@@ er &quot; bo@@ sons .
More stable field
The same applies to the H@@ ig@@ gs bo@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the H@@ ig@@ gs field , which must be &quot; distur@@ bed &quot; for the bo@@ son to appear .
Now , this H@@ ig@@ gs field is much , much more stable than the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field ; to ex@@ cite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a frozen pon@@ d which would need a very large ro@@ ck to w@@ rin@@ k@@ le the surface .
Which is why a huge par@@ ticle acceler@@ ator like the one at CE@@ R@@ N - the Lar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der is a ring with a 2@@ 7@@ km circum@@ ference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
The analo@@ gy with the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the H@@ ig@@ gs and mass .
In fact not all par@@ ticles , or all materials , inter@@ act with the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
Some , such as mag@@ nets , do so , but others don &apos;t - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fri@@ dge .
And likewise , not all par@@ ticles inter@@ act with the H@@ ig@@ gs field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the ph@@ ot@@ on ) do not .
Now , what is it that all this research &quot; can bring &quot; ? asks Ms Pla@@ mon@@ don .
For science , it serves to check the validity of the Stand@@ ard Mo@@ del ( S@@ M ) , and also allows physi@@ ci@@ ans to examine any discrepancies between the observations and pre@@ dictions of the S@@ M .
A number of people , moreover , fer@@ ven@@ tly hope that some will be found , because the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot; new physi@@ cs &quot; and plu@@ g certain ho@@ les in the Mo@@ del .
This , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation for gravity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Uni@@ verse ( re-@@ o@@ ops ! ) .
But to date no such discrepancies have been found at CE@@ R@@ N .
Re@@ percu@@ ssions
The repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there won &apos;t be any .
R@@ em@@ ember : in the very early 6@@ 0s , the pione@@ ers of the la@@ ser at Bel@@ l L@@ abor@@ atories did not suspect the revolution that would be tri@@ g@@ gered by their work .
They had an in@@ k@@ ling of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest .
In fact , the late Wil@@ lar@@ d Bo@@ yle - a physi@@ ci@@ st who worked at Bel@@ l Lab@@ s , where the la@@ ser was inven@@ ted in 19@@ 60 , and who himself developed the first continuous la@@ ser ( the first were pul@@ sed ) in 19@@ 62 - told us that initially the la@@ ser was rather seen as a &quot; la@@ b gad@@ get . &quot;
Just imagine ...
And then , applications can also come from all the instru@@ mentation that surroun@@ ds research .
For example , the same Wil@@ lar@@ d Bo@@ yle developed a small light sen@@ sor in 19@@ 69 , during his work in op@@ tics .
This sen@@ sor , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an &quot; eye &quot; to all digital cam@@ eras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel physi@@ cs prize in 2009 .
This does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ H@@ C will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
Pal@@ li@@ ative care - The best way to die ... &#@@ 12@@ 4@@ ; Le De@@ voir
With its D@@ ying with Di@@ gn@@ ity Commission , Que@@ be@@ c recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life .
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared .
However , in this vital area , much remains to be done .
Le De@@ voir attempted to look more closely .
Just a few weeks ago Mr L@@ . lived alone in his Mon@@ té@@ régi@@ e a@@ part@@ ment .
The f@@ ester@@ ing pro@@ state cancer had allowed him a two-@@ year res@@ pite .
&quot; They gave me five years to live , I &apos;@@ ve made it to seven , &quot; he says , with mixed emo@@ tions , lying in his bed at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bois pal@@ li@@ ative care home in B@@ elo@@ e@@ il , where he arrived the previous day .
&quot; But it &apos;s still a shock , you can never be prepared for it &quot; he adds .
The disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the to@@ i@@ let alone , and even eating alone .
S@@ it@@ ting in front of an appe@@ tising l@@ unch , he consen@@ ts to being helped to eat , re@@ signed .
C@@ ou@@ ra@@ geous , he even man@@ ages to s@@ mile , talks to the stran@@ gers bus@@ tling around him , bringing him his medi@@ cation , offering him a bat@@ h .
The courage of ordinary death .
&quot; What I want most is to be cu@@ red of my di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ e@@ a , it &apos;s humili@@ ating &quot; he confi@@ ded .
A few hours later , the team found a cure for this illness .
&quot; During our lives , we learn that a man pis@@ ses standing up , &quot; says Pi@@ erre Bro@@ deur , psycho@@ log@@ ist at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bois home .
Re@@ gres@@ sing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
&quot; It depends on the person &apos;s ability &quot; to accept the regres@@ sion , he says .
Because , in the opinion of a number of people working in pal@@ li@@ ative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such regres@@ sion .
P@@ ati@@ ents at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bois pal@@ li@@ ative care home all suffer from cancer .
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months .
At this stage , the team of doctors and nur@@ ses surrounding them no longer provides so-called &quot; cu@@ ra@@ tive &quot; care .
For Mrs A@@ . , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die &quot; conscious and suff@@ oc@@ ating . &quot;
But the disease has made me discover my children .
&quot; I have fine children &quot; she adds .
&quot; I don &apos;t wish for anything more in life &quot; she says , before accepting having a mas@@ k put on to help her brea@@ the .
She looks forward nevertheless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy .
At Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bois , a group of volunteers provides bo@@ di@@ ly care and help with feeding .
This is pal@@ li@@ ative care , given when there is nothing else that can be done .
To make death more comfortable .
In Que@@ be@@ c , there are pal@@ li@@ ative care be@@ ds for 1@@ 1,@@ 700 inhabitants .
This is very few when we know that we will all die one day .
Here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , one of the doctors at the home .
Whether at a physical com@@ fort , emotional or spi@@ ritual level .
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink bran@@ dy or Pe@@ p@@ si , whatever is their ti@@ p@@ ple .
Di@@ abe@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar .
And death is part of everyday life .
Yesterday evening , a be@@ er was served to Mr X , who died during the night .
This morning , it is his son who will finish the be@@ er at the feet of the dece@@ ased .
&quot; We help relatives as much as patients &quot; says Na@@ th@@ alie Sav@@ ard , Director of C@@ are .
At the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bois home , one day follows another but no two are alike .
Along with a 9@@ 3-@@ year-old man who is sav@@ ouring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly we@@ dged in his pil@@ low@@ s while to@@ asts are dr@@ un@@ k in his honour , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ young man is dying trag@@ ically , surroun@@ ded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
&quot; For six months , there have always been three to five be@@ ds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old &quot; says a concerned Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel .
53 % of patients admitted to the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bois home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital .
L@@ ack of access to pal@@ li@@ ative care
It is said that 77 % of Canadi@@ ans simply have no access to pal@@ li@@ ative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the termin@@ al stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home .
And a number of organisations , such as the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bois home and the Pal@@ li@@ ative C@@ are Society in Greater Montreal , speci@@ alise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
It is precisely this large gap in Que@@ be@@ c health care which has made a number of pal@@ li@@ ative care physi@@ ci@@ ans fear the adoption of a law on eu@@ than@@ asia and assisted suicide .
Since October , a manif@@ esto , signed by pal@@ li@@ ative care lu@@ min@@ aries including Dr Bal@@ four M@@ ount and Dr Bern@@ ard La@@ pointe , has been circu@@ lating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
According to Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , the Que@@ be@@ c health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality pal@@ li@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to eu@@ than@@ asia .
Recently , she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
I &apos;@@ m afraid that patients ask to die because they don &apos;t receive adequate care .
And at the same time , some on@@ co@@ log@@ ists work rel@@ ent@@ lessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst pro@@ g@@ no@@ ses .
Hé@@ lè@@ ne Richard &apos;s survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y .
When I announced to my on@@ co@@ log@@ ist that I was stopping the treatment , she told me she regret@@ ted that I had given up fighting , she said .
However , she had told me I was finished !
No all-@@ powerful care
Dr Mar@@ tel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care@@ -@@ gi@@ vers for not having acce@@ ded to their request after they have been reli@@ ev@@ ed of their pain by a pal@@ li@@ ative care team .
But it must be said that pal@@ li@@ ative care is not absolutely all-@@ powerful in the treatment of pain .
According to El@@ sie Mon@@ e@@ reau , Pal@@ li@@ ative C@@ are Director with the Pal@@ li@@ ative C@@ are Society in Greater Montreal , patients are resi@@ stant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
At the very end of life , physi@@ ci@@ ans then often resort to pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ dation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sle@@ ep until the time of death , either s@@ pora@@ dic@@ ally or permanently .
We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering .
Incre@@ as@@ ingly , an un@@ reli@@ ev@@ ed patient will have the option of having such pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ dation .
P@@ ati@@ ents who are not reli@@ ev@@ ed always say the same thing : &quot; I want to die . &quot;
But this does not necessarily mean &quot; I want you to eu@@ than@@ ise me , &quot; it means &quot; I want to be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot;
This report was made possible thanks to a journ@@ alism award from the Canada health research institutes .
Wi@@ despread real esta@@ te scandals in Que@@ be@@ c
Day after day high@@ way officials , building contr@@ actors , political party fun@@ d-@@ rais@@ ers and Italian mafia specialists tell what they know of a formidable &quot; system , &quot; combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade uni@@ on@@ ists and organised crime .
An &quot; industry &quot; which has cost Que@@ be@@ c taxpayers de@@ arly , especially in the 1990s and 200@@ 0s .
&quot; It is curious how the system is cru@@ mb@@ ling since we took drastic measures &quot; says Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au iron@@ ically , a Que@@ be@@ c politician and former Montreal Chi@@ ef of Police .
It was through him that the scandal broke in 20@@ 11 , in an in-depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Que@@ be@@ c , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean Cha@@ rest , had consen@@ ted only reluc@@ tantly .
The &quot; Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report &quot; established a direct link between industry , under-@@ the-@@ table financing of parties and bri@@ ber@@ y of officials .
&quot; Since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone repor@@ tedly saved a billion dollars on contracts , &quot; with certain people cur@@ bing their ins@@ tin@@ cts to get a share !
The Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission &quot; has already brought down two may@@ ors &quot; he adds , hoping that it will succeed in &quot; reve@@ aling the schemes behind the individuals . &quot;
A permanent anti-@@ corruption unit , created in 20@@ 11
The Perman@@ ent Anti-@@ Cor@@ ruption Un@@ it , created in 20@@ 11 , is also cou@@ pled with its army of government analy@@ sts , investig@@ ators , and audi@@ tors .
Plus the &quot; Mar@@ teau squ@@ ad &quot; policem@@ en who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Montreal &quot; se@@ wer car@@ tel &quot; to soft pe@@ dal on the inflation of contracts ...
In recent weeks , it has conducted a series of se@@ ar@@ ches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as Fran@@ k Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ co@@ tte , May@@ or of a sub@@ urban town .
Next on the list is apparently G@@ illes V@@ ail@@ lan@@ court , who has just re@@ signed from his post as May@@ or of L@@ aval , third largest city in Que@@ be@@ c .
He is suspected of poc@@ ke@@ ting repeated bri@@ bes in exchange for public contracts .
Others formally accused are Montreal high@@ way engine@@ ers and Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony Ac@@ curso and L@@ ino Z@@ ambi@@ to .
The latter caused a sen@@ sation by explaining the mechan@@ ics of the public contracts &quot; system &quot; to the commission .
He himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermedi@@ ary linked to the mafia who in turn paid the money to Union Mon@@ tré@@ al , May@@ or G@@ ér@@ ald Tre@@ mb@@ lay &apos;s party .
Mr Z@@ ambi@@ to has handed money out freely in the 200@@ 0s , giving over 8@@ 8@@ ,@@ 000 Canadian dollars ( rou@@ ghly 6@@ 8@@ ,@@ 000 euros ) to provin@@ cial parties , especially the Liberals then in power .
He also admitted having organised an illegal fun@@ dra@@ iser for former Liberal Depu@@ ty-@@ Prime Minister , Na@@ th@@ alie Nor@@ man@@ deau .
Se@@ wer contracts with inf@@ lated costs
In Montreal , the corruption &quot; system &quot; ran smoothly .
G@@ illes Sur@@ prenant , former public works engine@@ er , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gi@@ f@@ ts , invitations to tri@@ ps , gol@@ f tour@@ na@@ ments , restaur@@ ants , ho@@ c@@ key matches and bri@@ bes total@@ ling 7@@ 36@@ ,@@ 000 dollars , in exchange for se@@ wer contracts of which he inf@@ lated the costs .
Other high@@ way officials admitted having their pal@@ ms gre@@ ased by inf@@ lating invo@@ ices by 30 to 40 % , and by false ad@@ d-@@ ons .
Then an organiser of the May@@ or &apos;s party , Martin Du@@ m@@ ont , accused Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his co@@ ff@@ ers with dirty money .
Following these reve@@ lations , Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay re@@ signed in early November , plun@@ ging Montreal into a major crisis .
Chan@@ tal Rou@@ le@@ au was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm .
May@@ or of the bo@@ rou@@ gh of Ri@@ vi@@ è@@ re-@@ des@@ -@@ Pra@@ i@@ ries , to the East of the island , she pro@@ tested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and res@@ old for ... 1.@@ 6 million to develop@@ ers , at the he@@ ight of the real esta@@ te bo@@ om .
70 % dirty money in election campaigns
On the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she &quot; is following a thre@@ ad in order to find out how the system - infil@@ trated by ants - works , to put a stop to the gan@@ g@@ ren@@ e and catch the cul@@ prits . &quot;
The process , she says , is &quot; painful but positive . &quot;
The w@@ ound is being clean@@ ed , but Montreal would need its own investig@@ ative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these questionable practices .

Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au notes for his part that &quot; officials sto@@ le hundreds of millions of dollars , &quot; but he is especially concerned about the role of &quot; elected people aware of the scheme , &quot; when they were not up to their ne@@ cks in the sca@@ m !
Esti@@ ma@@ ting the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Que@@ be@@ c at 70 % , he says dr@@ y@@ ly : &quot; I was told that it was only a p@@ ale reflection of reality . &quot;
The Que@@ be@@ c government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : &quot; Until election expenses are strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . &quot;
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and party funding : &quot; We can &apos;t go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to rebuild the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . &quot;
Although this story tar@@ n@@ ishes the international image of Que@@ be@@ c and Montreal , Mr Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au inv@@ ites anyone lau@@ gh@@ ing to look in their own back@@ y@@ ard ...
&quot; P@@ S@@ G is not F@@ C Barcelona ! &quot;
This seas@@ on , you have taken on a new sta@@ ture with P@@ S@@ G .
How do you explain this progression ?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of P@@ S@@ G .
Some great players have arrived .
Every day I &apos;@@ m making progress alongside them .
The technical staff has also brought me a lot .
Day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .
And , in a match , it &apos;s easier .
Everything moves very fast in football .
But I don &apos;t get worked up .
From my de@@ but at the C@@ lai@@ re@@ fon@@ taine IN@@ F pre-@@ training centre to my transfer to Saint-@@ E@@ tienne , I &apos;@@ ve always moved step by step .
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Car@@ lo An@@ cel@@ otti ...
This summer &apos;s recru@@ its are used to playing matches at a high level .
They also know that every training session is crucial .
Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best .
On the other hand , Car@@ lo An@@ cel@@ otti gives me a lot as regards my position .
He &apos;s supported by depu@@ ties like Clau@@ de Ma@@ ke@@ le@@ le , who played in the same position as me .
Is An@@ cel@@ otti the man for the job ?
De@@ fini@@ tely .
An@@ cel@@ otti inspi@@ res respect among all the experts .
Today he has no equal in Li@@ gue 1 , and he &apos;s one of the best co@@ aches in Europe .
He has mas@@ ses of experience and has won many ti@@ tles with top clubs .
He &apos;s worked with great players .
I think he will bring more ti@@ tles to Paris .
In January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I was just coming back from a series of inju@@ ries .
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance .
What importance do you attach to the first part of the seas@@ on for P@@ S@@ G ?
In Li@@ gue 1 , Ly@@ on over@@ took us at the top .
But we &apos;@@ re waiting on the side@@ lines .
One of our main goals is the Cha@@ mpi@@ ons League : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way .
What is the club &apos;s goal in this competition ?
We &apos;@@ ll try to go as far as possible .
From now on , anything can happen .
But we &apos;@@ ll have something to say against some very good European teams .
First of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match .
Can P@@ S@@ G become a top European club in the short term ?
It already has the budget ...
To become a top European club , Paris needs to win ti@@ tles and keep it up over time .
Today , this is@@ n &apos;t the case .
Financi@@ ally , P@@ S@@ G has the means to make it happen .
In Li@@ gue 1 , would not winning the title , like last seas@@ on , be a big failure ?
De@@ fini@@ tely , it would be a major disappointment .
This year , we &apos;@@ re really committed to winning the champi@@ on@@ ship .
We we@@ ren &apos;t far away last seas@@ on .
In May , there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first .
It was a terri@@ fic seas@@ on .
We finished with 79 points .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , 79 points is good enough to be top ...
But another team , Mon@@ t@@ pel@@ lier , had an even more fantastic seas@@ on .
I think this is the year .
Even if big teams like Mar@@ se@@ ille , Ly@@ on and Bor@@ de@@ aux are competing for the title , I think we have the weapons to win .
Do you think the media expect too much of P@@ S@@ G ?
It &apos;s normal for them to expect a lot from us given what &apos;s been invested and the players we have .
We totally accept it .
After we won 4-@@ 0 at home against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that &apos;s definitely a bit frustr@@ ating .
You wonder what more people expect .
You &apos;@@ re never going to win 4-@@ 0 every weekend .
We &apos;@@ re not F@@ C Barcelona !
We &apos;@@ re trying to implement a game project .
It takes time to build a team .
The Cha@@ mpi@@ ons League proved we could hold our own .
Loo@@ k at Man@@ ch@@ ester City who , for two seas@@ ons , have failed to qualify for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
B@@ ased on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break !
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship .
Ly@@ on and Mar@@ se@@ ille , who were no good last seas@@ on , were &quot; boos@@ ted &quot; by the new P@@ S@@ G .
This shows that Li@@ gue 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we will be able to s@@ mile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
P@@ S@@ G seem totally dependent on the explo@@ its of Z@@ la@@ tan Ibra@@ him@@ o@@ vic .
So much so that people say there is a &quot; Z@@ la@@ tan dependence . &quot;
This means Ibra@@ him@@ o@@ vic is very successful and sco@@ res a lot of goals .
That &apos;s why he came , and he &apos;s proving he &apos;s the star of Li@@ gue 1 .
He &apos;s demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star .
Within the group , we respect the man and the player .
And also he respects the men he has around him .
What he has done is truly exceptional .
It pus@@ hes others to raise their level of play .
Thi@@ ago Silva , who is one of the best defenders in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ?
A disappointment .
I really wanted to play in this Euro .
Unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time .
I saw some things there and came out stronger .
Today , I &apos;@@ m playing well in selection matches .
Which is what I &apos;@@ ve been hoping for since my b@@ ap@@ tism with the B@@ lu@@ es .
I &apos;@@ ve learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour .
What do think about Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ cha@@ mps &apos;s first few months in charge of the B@@ lu@@ es ?
He has the results he wanted .
We &apos;@@ re well placed in the World quali@@ fying group .
The co@@ ach is tough , close to the players , and inspi@@ res them to win .
Like L@@ au@@ rent Blanc was .
But I don &apos;t want to make any compar@@ isons .
Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro .
I hope Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ cha@@ mps will take the B@@ lu@@ es to Brazil .
Di@@ d the good draw ( 1-@@ 1 ) s@@ n@@ at@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ?
That match gave us confidence .
Every@@ body fought for everybody .
Before that shock in Spain , I &apos;@@ d never experienced such a match in my career .
With B@@ it@@ coin , pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
In addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is pal@@ pa@@ ble : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopolies , leads to financial crises .
In fact , B@@ it@@ coin , inven@@ ted by Sa@@ to@@ sh@@ i N@@ ak@@ a@@ mo@@ to ( a pseu@@ don@@ y@@ m ) , is both a virtual currency ( but conver@@ tible into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange protocol like B@@ it@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ pe@@ er file exchange .
A@@ round 200@@ ,@@ 000 transactions have already been recorded via 15@@ ,@@ 000 computers on the network .
C@@ lose to a thousand web sites accept bit@@ coins as donations or means of payment .
The bit@@ coin exchange rate , after reaching a pe@@ ak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 20@@ 11 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a do@@ zen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ t@@ s@@ .@@ com site ) .
Nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products .
However , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
It describes bit@@ coin as &quot; the most successful virtual currency , &quot; &quot; in competition with the dollar or the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to conventional currencies . &quot;
B@@ it@@ coin differs from other types of virtual currency such as &apos; credits &apos; , used to progress in a vi@@ deo game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
The social network F@@ ace@@ book has also developed this kind of system .
But , on each occasion , a central authority controls and hand@@ les the exchanges .
With B@@ it@@ coin , all no@@ des in the network are both custo@@ di@@ ans of the book of accounts , audi@@ tors , currency issu@@ ers , and bu@@ yers and sel@@ lers .
How does the network operate ?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e-mail .
Ex@@ cep@@ t that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anony@@ mity .
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electr@@ on@@ ically by a du@@ al-@@ key en@@ cryp@@ tion system .
So the network can verify the authenti@@ city of the transaction .
U@@ sing the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the ex@@ changed bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network .
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book .
It passes through the resolution of a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical challenge issued to the computers , and the winner , a kind of interim central ban@@ ker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line .
This is a file ha@@ shing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital im@@ print .
Com@@ pu@@ ters &quot; take &quot; the new transaction and add a number to it , then &quot; ha@@ sh &quot; it all up .
The goal being to find the number that gives a special im@@ print ( lots of z@@ eros at the beginning ) .
Once this number has been found , the other no@@ des can easily check that it is the right one .
The transaction is then in@@ destru@@ cti@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the im@@ print .
If a user wanted to de@@ fraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be vali@@ dated by the network - the other would remain an orp@@ han because the two have different im@@ pr@@ ints .
The computer that resol@@ ves the challenge w@@ ins 50 bit@@ coins .
To avoid inflation , this award is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
The number of bit@@ coins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are divi@@ sible down to the hundred milli@@ on@@ th , which leaves some margin ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in compu@@ ting power .
The life of the network has had its ups and dow@@ ns .
W@@ eb@@ sites providing services for B@@ it@@ coin have been attacked and bit@@ coins in deposi@@ ts stolen .
&quot; The loopho@@ le used is not the protocol itself &quot; says Pi@@ erre No@@ i@@ z@@ at reas@@ sur@@ ingly , who has just launched Pay@@ mi@@ um , a real currency payment company that uses the B@@ it@@ coin network .
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anony@@ mous service .
But cash also has this weakness .
Maj@@ or players like Wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a refuse donations of this nature .
Others , such as the W@@ ord@@ Pres@@ s blo@@ g platform , accept them .
Recently , A@@ di Sha@@ mir and Dor@@ it R@@ on , from the W@@ ei@@ z@@ mann Institute in Israel , analysed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not circu@@ late .
In November , &quot; huge sel@@ l-@@ off@@ s &quot; were launched .
&quot; Thir@@ ty thousand dollars were ex@@ changed &quot; welcomes J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ abul , which conver@@ ts bit@@ coins to go@@ ld .
Pi@@ erre No@@ i@@ z@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
His system , Pay@@ t@@ uni@@ a , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a contac@@ tless payment by mobile , but it uses B@@ it@@ coin to vali@@ date transactions , which are thus cheaper .
Also the user man@@ ages his identity and can therefore be anony@@ mous .
The system is easy to implement by mer@@ chan@@ ts , who do not need to insta@@ ll new termin@@ als or software .
They just need to provide an address that a phone can &quot; photo@@ grap@@ h and recognise &quot; says Pi@@ erre No@@ i@@ z@@ at , who confirms he has thousands of users .
There is a general movement to re@@ ap@@ praise hier@@ arch@@ ical systems for more horizontal systems .
&quot; It will take time for B@@ it@@ coin to become firmly established , but 2013 could be a turning point , &quot; he predic@@ ts .
The ECB , in its report , says it will reas@@ s@@ ess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency &apos;s success .
We got out of Afghanistan .
What now ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( K@@ ap@@ is@@ a and S@@ uro@@ b@@ i ) .
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 20@@ 14 .
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything .
It is mainly Afghan pe@@ as@@ ants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists .
And ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the woun@@ ded , the ma@@ im@@ ed .
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former leaders in refuge in Pakistan , but often pe@@ as@@ ants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the So@@ vie@@ ts .
They want to defend their traditions , both ancient and ar@@ cha@@ ic , even though they have been joined by J@@ i@@ had@@ ists , Pakistan@@ is , Ara@@ bs , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , Taj@@ i@@ ks .
T@@ ol@@ er@@ ated , sometimes assisted , by local insur@@ gents , the latter will no longer be so when W@@ ester@@ ners become more scar@@ ce .
The departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ ra@@ b base , which I observed from the top of h@@ ills of al@@ mon@@ d trees plan@@ ted with French funding , was carried out in an or@@ derly fashion .
Con@@ vo@@ ys of tru@@ cks and arm@@ oured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked , over@@ flow@@ n by he@@ licop@@ ters .
There will be no wave of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 20@@ 14 .
C@@ ir@@ cum@@ stances have changed since their ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble advance between 1994 and 1996 .
At that time Kabul was empty , the country being tor@@ n apart by the strugg@@ les between different fac@@ tions .
Their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liber@@ ation , a return to safety .
Afghan@@ is paid the price of the obscu@@ ran@@ tism of these pe@@ as@@ ants by the organisation of Al-@@ Qaeda , but their situation has not improved today .
Former Mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ din , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are alli@@ ed in the desire to keep women in an inferior position .
The main anti-@@ Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001 .
They became profi@@ teers , sei@@ zing government land to re@@ sell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from huge American out@@ sour@@ cing contracts .
They have become dis@@ credi@@ ted ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves .
The people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of thi@@ eves .
Many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American larg@@ esse will leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
The young people are tired of war and its ideo@@ logies .
They have rub@@ bed shoul@@ ders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreciated the benefits .
Rou@@ ghly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population .
In towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and boys alike .
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obscu@@ ran@@ tism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders .
All of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile phones ; television , with its Turkish so@@ ap oper@@ as that show a modern world , is followed everywhere .
The army is now present .
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ?
Former comman@@ ders of the anti-@@ Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provin@@ cial mili@@ ti@@ as , which will escape the central power .
Afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation , in the image of the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralised State , with strong presidential power , abolishing the post of Prime Minister , which had existed since the 19@@ 64 Constitution .
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 20@@ 14 .
But , since the 5@@ 0s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid .
No industries have been re-@@ established , no da@@ ms are in good condition , no major ir@@ rig@@ ation systems have been re@@ pai@@ red .
Everything is imported ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables .
The Pri@@ ority is left to private initiative .
In a country ru@@ ined by thirty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary .
The rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge min@@ eral wealth .
This only added to the feeling that the W@@ ester@@ ners were only there to seize it .
With no energy to process the iron ore or cop@@ per on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , there is no mining .
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Ay@@ na@@ k cop@@ per mine , leaving international ar@@ cha@@ e@@ o@@ log@@ ists ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Bud@@ d@@ his@@ t site and remain the largest employers in the province .
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely depend , to restore normal relations .
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls &apos; high school , boys &apos; high school , French De@@ part@@ ment at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ological Delegation .
Since 2009 , to try to &quot; win hearts and minds &quot; and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions , a &quot; civi@@ l-@@ military actions &quot; service from the Ministry of defence ( C@@ imi@@ c ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French NGO , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages .
These projects , involving large numbers of local labour , have helped to contain the insur@@ gency : ir@@ rig@@ ation , wel@@ ls , drinking water , re@@ fores@@ tation , fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cultiv@@ able areas .
What will we leave as a souvenir , after two billion euros of military spending ?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very hard in these val@@ le@@ ys often located over 2,@@ 000 metres above sea level .
The E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in K@@ ap@@ is@@ a province .
To be in a position to free themselves from the u@@ prising led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them .
A Constitution by force in Egypt
A new g@@ amble for President Mo@@ ham@@ med Mor@@ si .
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
Taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day .
Just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work .
For two years Egypt has reli@@ ed on a provisional text , amended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ g@@ li@@ os .
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country .
According to his opponents , the President is persever@@ ing in his &quot; auto@@ cra@@ tic deli@@ ri@@ um , &quot; continuing to &quot; go back on his word &quot; and &apos; tram@@ ple the law . &quot;
His supporters affirm that this is the quic@@ k@@ est way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by speeding up the transition process .
A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks .
A very short period , which forces the Bro@@ thers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
For the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute ra@@ ges throughout the country .
Mo@@ ham@@ med Mor@@ si seems convinced that Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will vote favourably , as he stated in an interview with the American wee@@ kly Time .
Particularly since a has@@ ty vote sm@@ ac@@ ks of an ulti@@ matu@@ m to the Egyptian people : &quot; Either you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , &quot; these powers supposedly expi@@ ring following adoption of the Constitution .
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constitu@@ ent Assembly , with a large Isla@@ mist majority , voted on the text yesterday .
Most of the liber@@ als were missing .
In mid-@@ November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had sla@@ m@@ med the door , feeling they had failed to assert their views .
Representa@@ tives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done likewise .
In order to obtain a quorum , 11 members , alter@@ na@@ tes , were ha@@ sti@@ ly added yesterday morning .
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood .
Not surpris@@ ingly , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously .
Com@@ menta@@ tors were also am@@ used that one of the only diver@@ sions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of pra@@ yer , some Committee members feeling that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly clock was wrong .
The text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 2@@ 34 articles .
The main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 197@@ 1 Constitution , stipu@@ lating that &quot; the principles of sh@@ aria are the main source of law . &quot;
The Salaf@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace &quot; the principles &quot; by &quot; the rules , &quot; which would have allowed stricter application .
For the Isla@@ mis@@ ts , the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society .
&quot; Hy@@ po@@ crisy &quot; respond the liber@@ als , who see only a communication coup .
Because in their opinion Isla@@ mis@@ ation of the Constitution is done through other articles .
They refer in particular to article 220 , which grants Al-@@ Az@@ har University an advisory role , with particular reference to veri@@ fying the conformity of the laws with sh@@ aria .
According to Egypt specialist S@@ ophi@@ e Pom@@ mi@@ er , this is worrying because &quot; the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
This suggests the begin@@ nings of a the@@ ocra@@ cy . &quot;
The liber@@ als &apos; fears are also fu@@ elled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one .
&quot; For the time being , there is no concrete religious implication .
With this Constitution , things remain under civil rule .
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law scho@@ lars but acade@@ mics , some trained in the French system &quot; quali@@ fies Ale@@ x@@ is B@@ lou@@ et , who is writing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition .
But he acknowledges that &quot; there may be some ambiguity regarding article 220 , because the terms used b@@ orrow from the religious vo@@ cab@@ u@@ lary .
Re@@ ference is made in particular to &quot; fi@@ q@@ h &quot; &#91; Islamic jurisprudence , E@@ di@@ tor &apos;s note &#93; .
And the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pronoun@@ ce on it . &quot;
Be@@ yond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic .
The Muslim Bro@@ thers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime .
Another issue : the powers conferred on the army .
In accordance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but to a National Defence Council .
Nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military tribun@@ als , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
Who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider repressive .
The offence of bla@@ s@@ ph@@ em@@ y is maintained and insul@@ ts are now prohibited , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
In addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights He@@ ba Mor@@ a@@ ye@@ f , from Human Rights Wat@@ ch .
In her opinion , the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36 .
The word was not included in the previous Constitution .
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
Sup@@ por@@ ters of the Head of State will mar@@ ch on Saturday .
In Israel , ho@@ ly places await Ukrainian tourists , the om@@ p@@ hal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water
The Ho@@ ly L@@ and comb@@ ines the s@@ pl@@ end@@ our of bibli@@ cal tru@@ ths , modern com@@ fort and pri@@ me@@ val nature .
A@@ i@@ F &#91; Ar@@ gu@@ ment@@ i i F@@ ak@@ ti &#93; newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel .
Let &apos;s wor@@ ship the ho@@ ly places
It is worth visiting the Ri@@ ver Jordan where J@@ es@@ us was b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed .
It is considered that all who enter this b@@ ap@@ tism &quot; bat@@ h &quot; are bles@@ sed by God .
Gali@@ le@@ e is the place where J@@ es@@ us performed his ma@@ gic : turned water into wine at a we@@ d@@ ding , wal@@ ked on water , cal@@ med a stor@@ m , and filled the nets .
This is also where J@@ es@@ us came before his dis@@ ci@@ ples and after the re@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion .
But the biggest number of ho@@ ly places is in Jerusalem .
Be@@ lie@@ vers walk through the W@@ ay of G@@ rief or V@@ ia Do@@ loro@@ sa .
It starts by the An@@ ton@@ ia For@@ tress - Pra@@ e@@ tori@@ um - where the judgement took place , and brings us along the streets of the O@@ ld T@@ own to the Church of the Ho@@ ly Se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re on Gol@@ go@@ th@@ a - the place of the cruci@@ fi@@ xi@@ on , S@@ tone of Un@@ ction and the place of J@@ es@@ us &apos; bu@@ rial .
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian om@@ p@@ hal@@ os , which symboli@@ zes the salv@@ ation of mankind .
The Ho@@ ly Cross Mon@@ as@@ tery in Jerusalem is e@@ rec@@ ted at the site that , according to Christian le@@ gen@@ d , yiel@@ ded the tre@@ e used to make the cross for J@@ es@@ us &apos; cruci@@ fi@@ xi@@ on .
Jerusalem has the most ho@@ ly places for the Jews as well - the W@@ ailing Wall , which remained from a temp@@ le destroyed by the Rom@@ ans in 70 A@@ D .
According to tradition , people of different fai@@ ths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled .
Tra@@ vel along a vertical
Ru@@ ins of the M@@ ass@@ ada For@@ tress remain from a secret refuge from enemies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family .
They are located on cli@@ ffs in the mountains at an elev@@ ation of 450 m above sea level .
They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain cli@@ mb@@ ing .
Others are delivered to this historical moun@@ tain@@ top by a cab@@ le@@ way .
In the north of the country , at an elev@@ ation of 16@@ 00@@ -@@ 20@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which f@@ ills up with tourists in winter months .
A shu@@ ttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain .
The total length of ski p@@ istes is 45 km .
According to an ancient le@@ gen@@ d , pagan go@@ ds used to live on the mountain .
V@@ isi@@ t unique mu@@ seu@@ ms
This country has about 300 mu@@ seu@@ ms .
You won &apos;t be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit .
Among them - Mu@@ seu@@ m of Israel , located close to Knesset ( Parliament ) .
It has ancient Qu@@ m@@ ran man@@ us@@ cri@@ p@@ ts and De@@ ad Sea s@@ cro@@ lls found in the c@@ aves of the Ju@@ dean deser@@ t , along with about 5@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ological and an@@ thro@@ po@@ logical arte@@ facts .
The Mu@@ seu@@ m of Ar@@ t in T@@ el-@@ Avi@@ v is also interesting .

In A@@ k@@ ko , you can visit the bat@@ h mu@@ seu@@ m Al-@@ Bas@@ ha , which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish ba@@ ths with models of visitors and bat@@ h atten@@ dants of the time .
In Ca@@ es@@ area , it is worth visiting the unique private R@@ all@@ i Mu@@ seu@@ m , where you can enjoy the s@@ cul@@ p@@ tures of Dal@@ i and Ro@@ din .
There are no tour gui@@ des or gi@@ ft shops .
En@@ try is free of charge , and contributions are strictly not allowed .
The fifth one is the Ho@@ locaust Mu@@ seu@@ m or Y@@ ad V@@ as@@ he@@ m in T@@ el-@@ Avi@@ v , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
The most tragic section is the children &apos;s mem@@ ori@@ al , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas cha@@ mbers .
You go in and find yourself in complete dar@@ k@@ ness .
S@@ tar@@ s are g@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing ,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died .
Ukraine is mentioned there too .
W@@ ell@@ ness
There are three resort areas in Israel , located on the coasts of the Mediterranean , Red , and De@@ ad Se@@ as .
Each have sw@@ im@@ ming po@@ ols , aqu@@ a par@@ ks , dol@@ ph@@ in@@ aria and o@@ ce@@ an@@ aria .
It is notable that one can swi@@ m in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water temper@@ ature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air war@@ ms to 23 degrees .
The De@@ ad Sea is even war@@ mer , and people swi@@ m in it all year round .
Incidentally , it is the most unusual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the planet - 4@@ 17 m below sea level .
Its az@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily keeps you af@@ lo@@ at , even if you don &apos;t know how to swi@@ m .
The surrounding landscap@@ es are sur@@ real in their beau@@ ty .
People come here to undergo a course of treatment using sal@@ t water - w@@ rap@@ s and medicinal mu@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have der@@ mati@@ tis , aller@@ gies , as@@ th@@ mas , ec@@ z@@ em@@ as , ar@@ thri@@ tis , b@@ ron@@ chi@@ tis , or diabetes , or to return emotional balance .
Tou@@ ch the my@@ s@@ teries of anti@@ qu@@ ity
They are preserved in the old section of T@@ el-@@ Avi@@ v - in the town of J@@ aff@@ a on the Mediterranean Sea .
The famous sea route conne@@ cting Egypt , Syria , A@@ na@@ to@@ lia , and Mes@@ o@@ pota@@ mia runs through it .
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian le@@ gen@@ ds .
According to le@@ gen@@ ds , this is where No@@ ah built his ar@@ k and Per@@ se@@ us saved the beau@@ ty An@@ dro@@ me@@ da , with whom he lived a long and happy life .
Tour@@ ists really like to wan@@ der the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ dia@@ c .
They say , if you touch the w@@ alls on the street of your sign , fortune will come to you .
In J@@ aff@@ a , you can meet new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for pho@@ to sessions .
And in Ca@@ es@@ area - the city of King Her@@ od - you can walk around a Rom@@ an the@@ a@@ tre , &quot; capture &quot; the C@@ rus@@ ader fortress .
During the Rom@@ an period , Ca@@ es@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ de@@ a and the residence of Rom@@ an pre@@ fec@@ ts , including Pon@@ ti@@ us Pi@@ late .
The carefully restored the@@ a@@ tre is now used for evening concer@@ ts and oper@@ a performances .
A note for the tourist
When you go to Israel , don &apos;t worry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country &apos;s population speaks Russian .
For the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily ex@@ changed for she@@ k@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3.@@ 8 she@@ k@@ els ) .
City transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high-speed tra@@ m , and H@@ ai@@ fa has the only sub@@ way line in the country , comprising six stops and conne@@ cting upper town with lower .
In essence , it is an under@@ ground cable railway .
A tic@@ ket for any type of city transportation costs 6 she@@ k@@ els , and you can ri@@ de for 1.5 hours with transfers .
According to the Jewish tradition , Sab@@ bat@@ h is celebra@@ ted in Israel .
Be@@ tween Friday evening and the sun@@ set on Saturday , markets , sto@@ res , and public transportation stop working .
The work week starts on Sunday morning .
Many ca@@ fes , restaur@@ ants and ho@@ tels have only ko@@ sh@@ er food , with no por@@ k , sea@@ food , fish with no sc@@ ales , or dis@@ hes that combine milk with meat .
There is a wide selection of dis@@ hes from la@@ m@@ b and beef , sou@@ ps and des@@ ser@@ ts coo@@ ked using co@@ con@@ ut milk , traditional Jewish hum@@ mus pas@@ te , various sau@@ ces , fal@@ af@@ el ( b@@ alls made of ground chic@@ k@@ pe@@ as ) , fruits and vegetables .
The streets of Israel don &apos;t have hom@@ eless do@@ gs .
But there are many well-@@ fed cats , which walk around la@@ z@@ ily .
In the evening , they can even be seen sle@@ e@@ ping on ro@@ of@@ s of par@@ ked cars .
These pus@@ sy@@ cats like bus@@ y places and do not refuse treats .
Car ren@@ tal , depending on car type , costs from 37 ( H@@ yun@@ da@@ i G@@ etz ) to 18@@ 8 ( Au@@ di A@@ 6 , Vol@@ vo S@@ 80 ) dollars a day .
Plus insurance of 15 dollars a day .
Bi@@ ke ren@@ tal costs 15 she@@ k@@ els a day .
Mu@@ seu@@ m entran@@ ce costs 30 she@@ k@@ els on average .
In numbers
In 2012 , over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel .
V@@ isi@@ tors and holi@@ da@@ y@@ makers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , and Ukraine .
Be@@ tween January and October 2012 1@@ 18@@ ,@@ 800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Ho@@ ly L@@ and , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 20@@ 11 .
Only the &quot; high and mi@@ gh@@ ty &quot; make it to Moscow : migrants save money for language
While depu@@ ties and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has sca@@ m artists who sell fa@@ ke certificates .
Every year , 13 million mi@@ grant workers come to Moscow , S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg and other cities in Russia .
Mo@@ stly these are citizens of Central Asia : U@@ z@@ be@@ k@@ istan , Taj@@ ik@@ istan and Turkmen@@ istan .
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home .
A new law came into effect on December 1 , which oblig@@ es every mi@@ grant worker to pass a Russian language test .
For the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utili@@ ty services , household services , and retail .
But with time - as promised by the Federal Mi@@ gration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non-@@ residents .
In addition to language , Russian history and basi@@ cs of the legal system will be tested .
Langu@@ age knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit .
An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language .
People who received education certificates and diplom@@ as before the fall of the US@@ S@@ R in 1991 are also exempt under the law .
Pur@@ pose , do@@ om@@ ed fate , and the protection of rights
S@@ even testing points will be operating under the auspices of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian Langu@@ age , Pe@@ op@@ les &apos; Fri@@ end@@ ship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg State University ( SP@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions .
Mi@@ grants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such centres have been opened .
The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Duma members and the Federal Mi@@ gration Services .
But human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non-@@ residents ?
First of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery .
Many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Mi@@ gration Services of Russia , Vi@@ k@@ tor Se@@ be@@ le@@ v .
Rights protection should begin before their departure .
Only the system of organiz@@ ed selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
Mi@@ grants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certific@@ ate start to have problems .
If a mi@@ grant does not understand the language , says Se@@ be@@ le@@ v with certainty , he is do@@ om@@ ed to come across un@@ con@@ scienti@@ ous people , who , preten@@ ding to help , will force upon him a &quot; tic@@ ket &quot; to terrible , cra@@ mped bar@@ ra@@ cks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sla@@ ving away 12@@ -@@ 14 hours a day .
We receive many complaints from our migrants .
&quot; They are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are li@@ ed to , their passports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , &quot; confirms the Head of the M@@ ain Mi@@ grant Labour Administration of the Mi@@ gration Service of Taj@@ ik@@ istan To@@ li@@ b Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v .
Not be an@@ gry , bo@@ ss !
Nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
Naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Turks , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , and Taj@@ i@@ ks can afford even a basic education .
Their families don &apos;t even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , sho@@ es , and supplies .
After reaching adoles@@ cence , these ki@@ ds go to work at the first opportunity .
It is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit .
&quot; You feel hu@@ mi@@ lia@@ ted and inferior . &quot;
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language .
T@@ es@@ ting will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status .
If they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future .
In the meantime , most of the mi@@ grant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
&quot; Wel@@ come , or No Un@@ auth@@ ori@@ zed En@@ try &quot;
Many of the foreigners assert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy .
The reason lies in bureaucratic hur@@ dles and the already mentioned language difficulties .
In addition , leg@@ aliz@@ ation costs money : from 12@@ ,@@ 000 to 16@@ ,@@ 000 ru@@ bles .
Whe@@ reas a fa@@ ke registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand .
O@@ ffic@@ ers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fa@@ ke papers , without registration , hence the ex@@ tor@@ tion .
&quot; They ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes , te@@ a , &quot; U@@ med Kh@@ ush@@ k@@ ad@@ a@@ mo@@ v , a citizen of Taj@@ ik@@ istan , shared with journalists .
&quot; R@@ oll up , don &apos;t be cheap , get your ar@@ t@@ work &quot;
On the first day of the law &apos;s entry into effect it turned out that not only mi@@ grant registration documents can be fa@@ ke .
A few for@@ ged certificates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal Mi@@ gration Services officers already .
For@@ ged documents are prin@@ ted on a standard colour pr@@ inter .
Naturally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand ru@@ bles for them .
It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand .
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
For the moment , the authorities can promise mi@@ grant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
In addition , those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tou@@ gh@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons .
This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : C@@ L@@ IC@@ K sh@@ ots at we@@ d@@ dings , where there were no casu@@ alties , and the massacre sta@@ ged by Moscow lawyer D@@ mi@@ try V@@ ino@@ gra@@ do@@ v , resulting in C@@ L@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people .
Po@@ lic@@ em@@ en want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 .
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Safety and Anti-@@ Cor@@ ruption , Ir@@ ina Y@@ aro@@ vaya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future .
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by &quot; tightening the scre@@ ws . &quot;
An open letter appeared on@@ line , whose authors - representatives of different social ri@@ f@@ le organiz@@ ations - demand to abandon the &quot; sen@@ seless tou@@ gh@@ ening . &quot;
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal , said criminal lawyer V@@ asi@@ ly L@@ es@@ ni@@ k@@ ov to BBC Russia .
According to the Ministry of the Interior &apos;s statistics , 14@@ 2 crimes using fi@@ re@@ arms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,@@ 16@@ 8@@ ,@@ 000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period .
Auth@@ ors of the open letter are certain that the tou@@ gh@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the &quot; black &quot; market .
According to them , one can find any weapon at a low price right now .
Nonetheless , the Ministry of the Interior asser@@ ts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control .
Sup@@ pli@@ ers : from plants to officers
The &quot; black &quot; market of weapons is re@@ plen@@ ished through several channels .
There are five such channels , explains reti@@ red colon@@ el Vi@@ k@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years .
S@@ cre@@ en@@ shot of the site that accepts orders for weapons .
First : &quot; army or military loo@@ t , &quot; i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus .
&quot; We@@ apons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Cauca@@ si@@ ans , &quot; says Bar@@ an@@ ets .
Next are &quot; black weapons , &quot; stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies .
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that this covers weapons taken from police wa@@ re@@ houses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies &apos; employees .
Il@@ legal arms are taken to be sold from military wa@@ re@@ houses .
Ex@@ plo@@ sions have often been heard at military wa@@ re@@ houses .
&quot; There are proven the@@ ories that some of the fires were inten@@ tional , in order to cover the shortage , &quot; says the former military man .
Manu@@ fac@@ turers of weapons make their contribution , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets .
&quot; There are so many private weapons factories now , which do not en@@ dure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , &quot; says the expert .
Another source of the &quot; black &quot; market is trafficking .
An especially high number of gun@@ s and machine gun@@ s come from poor countries like Ky@@ r@@ g@@ y@@ z@@ stan .
&quot; There &apos;s production there , sometimes hand@@ made ; and a mafia has formed , which has organiz@@ ed a stream , &quot; explains the former military man .
Where do the weapons come from ?
Ex@@ perts counted the approxi@@ mate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the &quot; black &quot; market .
A report about this was prepared by the Centre of Pro@@ ble@@ ms An@@ aly@@ sis and Public Management P@@ lan@@ ning in 20@@ 11 .
Ex@@ perts analysed the reports of the De@@ part@@ ment of the Interior and Ros@@ sta@@ t , crimin@@ ology liter@@ ature and open data from por@@ tals on weapons .
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
H@@ al@@ f of all arms on the black market are there &quot; because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , &quot; states the report .
According to researchers &apos; data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is the@@ ft during production , 5 % is &quot; black ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology . &quot;
A sales consul@@ tant of one of the weapons sto@@ res , who wished to remain anony@@ mous , asser@@ ts that the weapons found by &quot; black &quot; di@@ gg@@ ers are not being bought any more , because they &apos;@@ re too old .
According to him , dealers go to the military wa@@ re@@ house for a new bat@@ ch of goods .
One piece , for example a T@@ T g@@ un can be bought from a warrant officer .
It is issued to him , and given through the f@@ ence .
&quot; He takes it to the city and sel@@ ls for 900 euros a piece with two ma@@ gaz@@ ines , &quot; he says .
&quot; The truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why perio@@ dic@@ ally , when the crime dete@@ ction rate is low , it conduc@@ ts test purcha@@ ses from illegal weapons mer@@ chan@@ ts , &quot; says the consul@@ tant .
&quot; Like in a lux@@ ury store &quot;
The bu@@ yer and sel@@ ler often find each other through friends .
I looked at sites , b@@ log@@ s , ti@@ ll someone responded , offering me to go to Be@@ go@@ vaya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the &quot; corner &quot; so we can negotiate .
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military com@@ menta@@ tor Vi@@ k@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets
To get a weapon , I need someone with connections , says the sales consul@@ tant . - I have an acqu@@ ain@@ tance , but I &apos;@@ m not sure it &apos;s reliable .
There are sal@@ es@@ men on labour markets , but one needs to &quot; come &quot; there condi@@ tionally &quot; from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a to@@ oth . &quot;
Right now , even if I need a few k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le@@ dus@@ ters , I get them through someone I trust .
He also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won &apos;t give him away .
Be@@ gin@@ ners look for weapons in different ways .
Former military man Vi@@ k@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a bu@@ yer of illegal weapons in the mid-@@ 1990 &apos;s , when he was preparing to publish an article about this .
The formu@@ las are still the same , according to him .
He was given an al@@ bu@@ m of pictures with &quot; anything and everything . &quot;
&quot; I felt like I was in a lux@@ ury store , &quot; he rec@@ alls .
According to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the bu@@ yer is not offered a pi@@ g in a po@@ ke - you can try out everything .
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the sel@@ ler and set a target there .
&quot; I am given the opportunity to sho@@ ot , and when I am certain that the weapon is good , we begin to negotiate , &quot; describes the expert .
S@@ tor@@ e on a sof@@ a
Internet se@@ ar@@ ches lead to sites and &quot; V@@ k@@ on@@ tak@@ te &quot; groups , where weapons &quot; for different purposes &quot; are on offer .
No documents or personal meetings are needed .
&quot; It &apos;s enough to have a certain sum of money , &quot; says the adver@@ ti@@ sement heading on the website &quot; Bu@@ y a pis@@ to@@ l or ri@@ f@@ le . &quot;
U@@ sers leave their requests and ask questions .
Can a minor buy ?
&quot; Without a licen@@ se , of course , &quot; asks user &quot; John &quot; ( name is changed ) .
&quot; W@@ ant to buy a T@@ T , Moscow , &quot; conci@@ sely requests &quot; F@@ ed@@ or@@ en@@ k@@ ov . &quot;
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of fa@@ ke sites and there are tons of potential bu@@ yers of military weapons .
People come like hun@@ gry fish to ba@@ it , and then mine coal in Si@@ ber@@ ia .
military com@@ menta@@ tor and former military man Vi@@ k@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets
I heard about this : normally the site is registered outside the area of applic@@ ability of the laws of Russia .
People accept orders .
The bu@@ yer pays at an AT@@ M .
&quot; In response , a pho@@ to is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden , &quot; says Pres@@ s Secretary of the Rights to We@@ apons non-governmental organiz@@ ation D@@ mi@@ try K@@ is@@ lo@@ v .
Vi@@ k@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to j@@ ail .
The Federal Security Service now spre@@ ads a big network of fa@@ ke sites and there are tons of potential bu@@ yers of military weapons .
&quot; People are like hun@@ gry fish after ba@@ it , and end in Si@@ ber@@ ia mining coal , &quot; - he says .
M@@ ak@@ arov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal fi@@ re@@ arms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts .
According to D@@ mi@@ try K@@ is@@ lo@@ v from the Rights to We@@ apons organiz@@ ation , a M@@ ak@@ arov g@@ un can be acquired for 1@@ 00@@ -@@ 300 dollars .
The wait time is a month to a month and a half .
It is ship@@ ped from long-term storage wa@@ re@@ houses by the mid-@@ level management of these wa@@ re@@ houses .
According to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to J@@ anu@@ ar@@ y@@ -O@@ c@@ tober 20@@ 11 , amounting to 22@@ ,@@ 900 , while the number of cases of the@@ ft and ex@@ tor@@ tion of weapons , am@@ muni@@ tion , explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7.@@ 8 % .
F@@ as@@ t-@@ food and super@@ market workers are on strike in the U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A@@ .
Up to a fourth of all American te@@ en@@ agers have worked the cash register at Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s at one time or another
In the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A@@ . against low salaries in super@@ markets of the Wal@@ mar@@ t chain and popular fast food chain restaur@@ ants like Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s , Bur@@ ger King , T@@ aco Bel@@ l , W@@ en@@ dy &apos;s and K@@ entu@@ ck@@ y F@@ ried Ch@@ ic@@ ken .
Right now , nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the n@@ in@@ th wave or it is destined to fi@@ zz@@ le out early .
A@@ ctions are being supported by unions and a series of left-wing organiz@@ ations .
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ mar@@ t and fast food cha@@ ins , the goal of the protes@@ ters is to create unions within them .
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet .
46 cents a year ?
A@@ ctions began last week after Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
On this day , some employees of the Wal@@ mar@@ t corpora@@ tion , which emplo@@ ys 2.@@ 2 million people around the world , left their work@@ places and pic@@ ke@@ ted together with the unions and left-wing activists from the corpora@@ tion sto@@ res that sell products to people on low-@@ to-@@ medium incomes .
Wal@@ mar@@ t sel@@ ls everything imagin@@ able , from di@@ aper@@ s , hunting ri@@ f@@ les and car batteries , to vacuum clean@@ ers , e@@ gg@@ s and milk .
Produc@@ ts in its sto@@ res are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major super@@ markets .
So many low-@@ paid Wal@@ mar@@ t employees shop only at their workplace .
A@@ v@@ ai@@ lability and assor@@ tment made Wal@@ mar@@ t one of the biggest American corporations .
According to critics , Wal@@ mar@@ t can afford to sell the products cheap@@ ly partly because it pays little to its employees .
These latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift tru@@ cks and han@@ d-@@ held s@@ can@@ ners .
Pro@@ tes@@ ters on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and compla@@ ined that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corpora@@ tion went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
A typical Wal@@ mar@@ t employee , receiving 9@@ .5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
Scienti@@ sts from the Ber@@ ke@@ ley University in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia argue that if Wal@@ mar@@ t raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corpora@@ tion 3.@@ 2 billion dollars .
This is about 1.@@ 1 % more than it spen@@ ds on salaries right now .
If Wal@@ mar@@ t fully shif@@ ts the cost of increasing wages to the shoul@@ ders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more .
In one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now .
Wal@@ mar@@ t supporters happi@@ ly note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corpora@@ tion .
Black Friday continued in its sto@@ res from 8 in the evening on Thursday ti@@ ll mid@@ night the next day , and during the period Wal@@ mar@@ t sold about 5@@ 000 products a second .
In total , its cash registers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday .
Representative of the corpora@@ tion , D@@ an F@@ og@@ el@@ man , asser@@ ted in an interview with a left-wing site , the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Po@@ st , that a total of &quot; less than five &quot; Wal@@ mar@@ t employees left the workplace , and the protest act was just &quot; another P@@ R tric@@ k &quot; of the union that organiz@@ ed it .
&quot; Free cash register ! &quot;
Pro@@ tests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ mar@@ t ( they &apos;@@ re not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they don &apos;t exist here yet ) , but Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s and other cheap restaur@@ ants .
Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s says that it sel@@ ls billions of por@@ tions , and despite this it do@@ es@@ n &apos;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work !
Ju@@ ma@@ ane W@@ illi@@ ams , member of the City Council of New York
At the moment , the minimum salary according to federal and N@@ Y law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour .
F@@ ast food restaur@@ ants increase it with time , but very little . On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour .
Nobody ear@@ ns less in this expensive city .
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money .
Once upon a time , almost a fourth of American te@@ en@@ agers went through Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s , working part-time after school , living with parents .
Fe@@ w saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long .
Now I continuously come across inter@@ views with Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s employees , who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children .
On the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall S@@ tre@@ et Journal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them .
Par@@ tici@@ p@@ ants of the protest that began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday near the Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s on 4@@ 0@@ th street and Mad@@ ison A@@ venue demanded that cas@@ hi@@ ers and coo@@ ks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their present wages .
They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry .
American law prohi@@ bits the administration from preventing this or pun@@ ishing activists of the union movement by n@@ ag@@ ging or fir@@ ing .
On the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life .
But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union .
One of them is the unusual turnover of employees .
Dis@@ agreeing
No@@ is@@ y protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaur@@ ants in Man@@ hat@@ tan .
The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s by Times S@@ qu@@ are , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . One of them , Ju@@ ma@@ ane W@@ illi@@ ams , said : &quot; Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s claims it sel@@ ls billions of por@@ tions , and despite this it do@@ es@@ n &apos;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! &quot;
Dem@@ on@@ strat@@ ors were supported by other prominent N@@ Y democrats , like Bill de Bla@@ si@@ o , a candidate for N@@ Y city mayor , who said : &quot; We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic wel@@ l@@ being , which every New Yor@@ ker deserves ! . &quot;
According to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
But only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York .
It is unclear right now whether this will spar@@ k a mass movement .
&quot; At the moment , the mind cannot be dece@@ ived too well &quot;
Among modern technology f@@ ans a popular topic is augmen@@ ted reality , la@@ tely seen primarily through the pris@@ m of special gla@@ sses .
At first , a functional model was shown by Go@@ og@@ le in the summer , at its annual conference . Then , in November , it was announced that Mic@@ ro@@ soft fi@@ led an application for patent too .
However , according to the conversation with the leader of the group of inter@@ active 3@@ D technologies in the Cam@@ bridge labor@@ atory of Mic@@ ro@@ soft , Sha@@ h@@ ra@@ m I@@ z@@ ad@@ i , gla@@ sses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .
They are drawn by the prospect of manipu@@ lating virtual objects in the air with b@@ are hands , creating virtual open sp@@ aces .

While people in general are stuck at working with pi@@ x@@ els on a fl@@ at s@@ creen and sometimes pointing fin@@ gers at them .
We want to look 5-@@ 10 years into the future and predict cardin@@ al changes in this interaction .
For example , X@@ box and K@@ ine@@ ct sen@@ sors are a step forward . Almost no X@@ box is sold without K@@ ine@@ ct today , because everyone likes control by ges@@ tures .
- What else awa@@ its us in the future ?
- Despite the fact that K@@ ine@@ ct shif@@ ted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a fl@@ at s@@ creen , sometimes in 3@@ D .
Information entry has improved ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .
We are trying to change this , working on truly three-@@ dimen@@ sional display systems based on various technologies , including proje@@ ction technologies .
We need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible .
But for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him .
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more conven@@ ient form .
Above all , get rid of these stupid virtual reality hel@@ mets !
- What do you think about voice control ?
It &apos;s a popular thing , but is it ove@@ resti@@ mated ?
- It clearly cannot be called a cu@@ re-@@ for@@ -@@ all - there &apos;s a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions .
In reality , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own nic@@ he .
For example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
Mo@@ vements were not recorded by a cam@@ era , but by a hand bra@@ ce@@ let that determined the movement of b@@ ones and mus@@ cles .
It &apos;s big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch .
In general , the future lies in the mixed control , e@@ .@@ g@@ . movement + voice .
- What do you mean ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bot@@ tle of water ?
You will talk and show at the same time .
- U@@ su@@ ally I just say .
- O@@ h , that will be very hard to dete@@ ct .
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mutual approximation .
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sen@@ sors that will enable more precise determination of a person &apos;s reaction .
This could be , e@@ .@@ g@@ . la@@ ser sen@@ sors . They have a decent depth resolution , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with X@@ box K@@ ine@@ ct sen@@ sors , what are your complaints about modern cam@@ eras ?
Not enough resolution , depth or something else ?
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three-@@ dimen@@ sional recognition .
Of course , it would be good to have eight me@@ ga pi@@ x@@ els with 1000 k / s speed .
It &apos;s not just the me@@ ga pi@@ x@@ els , though , but the quality of the ma@@ tri@@ x and the depth .
From the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the alg@@ ori@@ th@@ m design@@ ers .
So it &apos;s important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z ax@@ is .
Spe@@ ed , the number of images per second , is also very important .
Human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for ges@@ tures .
Ste@@ ven Ba@@ th@@ ic@@ he from our Re@@ d@@ mon@@ d labor@@ atory created a touch sen@@ sor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern seri@@ al sen@@ sors are closer to the latter indicat@@ or ( 6@@ 0-@@ 100 ) .
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine .
In my work , it would be very useful to have a dev@@ ice that does not require touch@@ ing and would have more images per second .
- Does the number of cam@@ eras need to be increased ?
- In K@@ ine@@ ct there are three cam@@ eras now , one of which is actually an infra@@ red em@@ it@@ ter and the second one , the recipient of the signal .
The third one is actually a regular sen@@ sor of visible range .
It is not applied to determine the object &apos;s depth .
Po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally , a large number of cam@@ eras could solve the problem ...
Or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calculations .
It would be nice to create a flexible an@@ alogue K@@ ine@@ ct , play with the flexi@@ on of cam@@ era disposition and see how this will help in three-@@ dimen@@ sional determination of the position .
- As far as I remember , Mic@@ ro@@ soft did not present its gla@@ sses to the public , unlike Go@@ og@@ le .
D@@ on &apos;t you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augmen@@ ted reality technologies ?
- Certainly it is not very conven@@ ient to walk around with a s@@ mar@@ t phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the co@@ ol@@ est option would be &quot; transitional &quot; augmen@@ ted reality , where you could shift from gla@@ sses to s@@ mar@@ t phone , proje@@ ction display , and everywhere else based on a clou@@ d platform .
G@@ la@@ sses are a very personal dev@@ ice , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - augmen@@ ted reality based on gla@@ sses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people .
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual ho@@ logra@@ phi@@ c objects in the air is available not only to Tony S@@ tar@@ k from I@@ ron@@ man , but to a regular person .
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out : no tacti@@ le feed@@ back !
Han@@ ds feel nothing !
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge ?
- In my lec@@ tures I often say that augmen@@ ted reality is the seventh consecu@@ tive attempt at the interaction between man and machine .
I think that the eigh@@ th will probably be the addition of tacti@@ le sen@@ sations .
For now , one of the interesting tric@@ ks is to use the second hand as a sort of ma@@ tri@@ x for the image .
It is great at regis@@ tering pus@@ hes !
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these &quot; images in the air &quot; a sense of tan@@ gi@@ bility , for example , the interference of several targeted ul@@ tras@@ ound ra@@ ys in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sen@@ sation , but very weak right now , as if someone ble@@ w on your finger@@ ti@@ p .
There are also w@@ ris@@ t bra@@ cele@@ ts that affect the ner@@ ve end@@ ings in fin@@ gers , which is also a promising area .
- Have you tried to dece@@ ive the mind ?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ?
- This is a good idea and we ha@@ ven &apos;t tried this yet .
It conce@@ als one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physi@@ cally in a very limited space to believe that he is wal@@ king along an open , almost limit@@ less space ; we are working on the concept of t@@ read@@ mil@@ ls ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and gi@@ ant bal@@ lo@@ ons .
So far dece@@ iv@@ ing the mind has had limited success , there &apos;s work for many years to come .
That &apos;s what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very begin@@ nings .
Ju@@ d@@ gement calls instead of culture - Ros@@ bal@@ t@@ .@@ r@@ u
Ros@@ bal@@ t continues the project S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg A@@ van@@ t-@@ garde , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the avant-@@ garde of culture and art .
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often reco@@ gni@@ zed in Europe , by@@ passing fa@@ me in Russia .
The new player in Ros@@ bal@@ t - the bold arti@@ st Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller .
The whole city knows Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller , a be@@ ar@@ ded man dres@@ sed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Mu@@ seu@@ m , or by the Su@@ m@@ mer Gar@@ den , or at fashi@@ onable parties and shows .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller &apos;s work always brings in crow@@ ds of people , no matter where they are ex@@ hibi@@ ted .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller is one of the purely S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg social and philosoph@@ ical stor@@ y@@ tel@@ lers and cre@@ ators of new my@@ tho@@ logy .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller is an outstanding man of the S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg avant-@@ garde of the late 80 &apos;s early 90 &apos;s .
Moreover , he is a city man , who makes people s@@ mile on the street and lif@@ ts up everyone &apos;s spirit .
Recently he took up the street or@@ gan and became S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg &apos;s music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ an existence , philosophy and image .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , why do you walk around the city all in red , not y@@ el@@ low or tur@@ quo@@ ise , for example ?
- I chose the colour red as a fashion design@@ er engaged in look and image .
In this world , red is a compromise between arti@@ st , ima@@ ge@@ -@@ ma@@ ker and society .
Although in society , everything that is not grey causes aggression and ag@@ itation of the bad kind .
But my provo@@ cations are aimed at starting conversation .
The whole history of my provoc@@ ative actions is an invitation to discussion .
- When did you realise that you must be an arti@@ st ?
- At an ex@@ hibi@@ tion in the N@@ ev@@ sky House of Culture , where my work was displayed .
It became clear to me that this is my path .
Then , the wave of older free , un@@ official artists was gone , while new , free artists like me were not understood .
I became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post-@@ G@@ az@@ a-@@ N@@ ev@@ sky style artists ( &quot; post-@@ ga@@ zon@@ ev@@ s@@ ch@@ ina &quot; ) , which led to P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a-@@ 10 , and the wave was no longer .
I &apos;@@ m drawn to the@@ a@@ tre , clothing , music , all gen@@ res except for liter@@ ature .
- And all this has been united in your Ar@@ t-@@ cl@@ ini@@ c ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
In 1995 , I occupied the territory on P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a-@@ 10 , and while the renov@@ ation work had not started , there was a musi@@ cal and creative club , a Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ an club , the house of the S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg Bo@@ hem@@ ia .
Many were born there : NO@@ My , T@@ equi@@ la J@@ az@@ z , I remember when Sh@@ n@@ ur was brought there with the Van Go@@ gh &apos;s E@@ ar project .
Sh@@ n@@ ur and his friends li@@ p sang easy son@@ gs , we@@ aring tight le@@ ot@@ ards , and the now tr@@ en@@ dy com@@ poser I@@ g@@ or V@@ do@@ v@@ in was with them .
When the group began to play live , it became L@@ en@@ in@@ grad .
Trak@@ h@@ ten@@ berg was the presen@@ ter of many progra@@ ms before H@@ ali@@ -@@ Gal@@ i times .
We gave them Trak@@ h@@ ten@@ berg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and men@@ tor@@ ing he received from us .
G@@ all@@ ery D 137 , G@@ ri@@ bo@@ ye@@ do@@ v club - all these echo the Ar@@ t-@@ cl@@ ini@@ c .
That is where our staff and regular customers left for .
I am a h@@ ero of the last century , when culture meant something .
In 2000 , there was a poll in the press , for the People of Our City prize .
I was nomin@@ ated Ar@@ ti@@ st of the Year , my cli@@ ma@@ x came to an end .
In the new times , it is un@@ comfortable to work by old rules . I &apos;@@ m a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century .
In our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popu@@ lar@@ ity are different . You can be popular , but not very cultural .
- Your work is marked by a reco@@ gni@@ z@@ able style .
- Many of my works are h@@ its , with clearly reflected relevance and acu@@ ity .
I will have a programme ex@@ hi@@ bit , &quot; Russian mu@@ seu@@ m in c@@ low@@ ns . &quot;
C@@ low@@ ns are a ti@@ m@@ eless category .
I was social before , now it is painful and scar@@ y to be like that .
But everything is blu@@ r@@ red in c@@ low@@ ns , tragedy is removed .
I like gro@@ tes@@ que , I have gro@@ tes@@ que ideas .
For example , saving the world by totalitarian changing of clo@@ th@@ es by order .
N@@ ow@@ adays , people are judged by appearance , not their in@@ ner qualities .
Who knows , maybe you cannot sha@@ ke his hand , and need to sp@@ it in his face .
And the lie will go away with the help of changing clo@@ th@@ es .
- Recently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a character .
Who fits the role better than I ?
- Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful ?
- N@@ ow@@ adays , commercial art should be ne@@ at , consider@@ ate , swe@@ et .
There is a dis@@ integration of cultures .
People used to get together in f@@ loc@@ ks , Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ ans liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
Now , everybody is divided into mic@@ ro societies , it &apos;s hard to be liked by everyone .
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all .
Now you have to think who you will please .
Now , each cul@@ t h@@ ero has 100 f@@ ans .
- But several thousand come to Sta@@ s Mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il@@ ov !
- The cas@@ t-@@ outs go to see him , the sexu@@ al-@@ social sphere is at work there .
But 300 people will come for culture , not 10@@ ,@@ 000 . In the end , there &apos;s less management , money , everything dies out .
I have f@@ ans ; the main thing is not to betra@@ y them , not to spo@@ il what I have earned .
In my youth , I pain@@ ted such art that one collec@@ tor had it han@@ ging on the same wall with Fal@@ k and L@@ ari@@ on@@ ov .
I started with pain@@ tings , which people usually end with .
Con@@ cep@@ ts are often mixed up these days .
People say : spi@@ ritual culture , consumer culture .
There is no culture in consu@@ mer@@ ism , it &apos;s &quot; from another oper@@ a . &quot;
I am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture . I gre@@ w up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of pain@@ ting .
This is the culture I &apos;@@ m for .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , what is S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg missing ?
- Good cultural experts .
There is such a thing : an official for culture .
But not everyone can be engaged in culture .
Under the right ru@@ lers everything was different . K@@ ings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts .
There are good consul@@ tants in Moscow right now .
Here in S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
Ju@@ d@@ gement calls are what thri@@ ve now .
Even Er@@ art , but they &apos;@@ re different because they say honestly that we don &apos;t accept all modern art . There are some artists , who need to find other mu@@ seu@@ ms for themselves .
- What does S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg mean to you ?
- S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is be@@ dro@@ ck there .
It &apos;s hard for art to grow on our ro@@ cks .
We need cultural be@@ dro@@ ck , but we now have more writ@@ ers than read@@ ers . This is wrong .
In Europe , there are many curious people , who go to art ex@@ hi@@ bits , concer@@ ts .
Here , this la@@ yer is th@@ in .
We need to make art fashi@@ onable , as it was in the beginning of last century .
The project is supported by the S@@ t@@ . Peters@@ burg grant .
G@@ ive birth in space
The earth is in danger .
Global warming or an encounter with a k@@ iller as@@ tero@@ id .
Car@@ av@@ ans of cos@@ mic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet .
To save humanity , the question is how to propag@@ ate our race in conditions of wei@@ ght@@ lessness or on that replacement planet ?
I think the choice is small .
There are only two actual plan@@ ets that can be explo@@ red even hypo@@ the@@ tically .
&quot; Ven@@ us and M@@ ars , &quot; says Sen@@ ior Res@@ ear@@ cher of the P@@ .@@ K@@ . Sh@@ tern@@ berg State A@@ str@@ on@@ om@@ y Institute ( G@@ AI@@ S@@ h ) Vla@@ di@@ mir Sur@@ din .
But while conditions on M@@ ars are more appropriate for life , Ven@@ us has 5@@ 00@@ -@@ degree tempera@@ tures .
Life is possible only at a high al@@ titude or on the or@@ bit of Ven@@ us ... in space .
The question of reproduction in space began with flora .
H@@ al@@ f a century ago , experiments were run on plants .
Four generations of pe@@ as grown in or@@ bit were no different from their earth counterparts .
Then , in@@ sec@@ ts were b@@ red in or@@ bit , small fruit f@@ lies .
In 1979 , qu@@ ail e@@ gg@@ s were sent to space , to check how an embryo develops in wei@@ ght@@ lessness .
We get an absolutely normal chic@@ k .
But then the problem begins .
&quot; The problem is related to the fact that this chic@@ k needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , &quot; explains head of the labor@@ atory of the Institute of Me@@ dical and Bi@@ ological Pro@@ ble@@ ms ( IM@@ BP ) R@@ AN Vla@@ di@@ mir Sy@@ che@@ v .
Having found no support , chic@@ ks were tumb@@ ling around in dis@@ order .
After 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete atro@@ ph@@ y of ins@@ tin@@ cts .
Ch@@ ic@@ ks did not react to light and sound .
And the problem was that they simply died after four days .
&quot; We b@@ red chic@@ ks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , &quot; says Vla@@ di@@ mir Sy@@ che@@ v , confirming the failure of the experiment with chic@@ ks in space .
The last biological &quot; mini-@@ ar@@ k &quot; with animals fle@@ w into or@@ bit 16 years ago .
In spring 2013 , experiments will continue .
However , only sa@@ me-@@ sex beings will be on the Bi@@ on bio-@@ satellite .
There was an experiment with ra@@ ts , who were sent to space with fo@@ e@@ tus .
In principle , there was nothing extraordinary there .
&quot; This was on bio-@@ satellites , but again , it was a singu@@ lar experiment and such research needs to be conducted , &quot; says Vla@@ di@@ mir Sy@@ che@@ v .
After lan@@ ding , the cos@@ mic ra@@ ts had b@@ abi@@ es .
But it &apos;s hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space .
It &apos;s not an easy task .
Anim@@ als simply cannot follow their sexual ins@@ tin@@ ct , when they &apos;@@ re out of their familiar environment .
In principle , people , unlike animals , can .
H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens have abstr@@ act thinking , and are able to create a fitting emotional background .
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons .
But women have been flying to space for 50 years .
The biggest risk was for Te@@ res@@ h@@ ko@@ va .
The most valuable thing for humanity is the female body .
Our &quot; Se@@ ag@@ ul@@ l &quot; left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be O@@ K after flying to space .
Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight .
&quot; Nobody answered this question , &quot; says ro@@ cket and space industry ve@@ ter@@ an , V@@ akh@@ tan@@ g V@@ ach@@ n@@ ad@@ ze .
In June 19@@ 64 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman in space Val@@ en@@ tina Te@@ res@@ h@@ ko@@ va gave birth to a daughter .
The child &apos;s father , An@@ dri@@ an Ni@@ ko@@ la@@ ev , was also a cos@@ mon@@ aut .
In 1988 , the second woman cos@@ mon@@ aut , S@@ ve@@ t@@ lana Sav@@ it@@ sk@@ a@@ ya , who went into or@@ bit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son .
However , the risk remains .
We have few , very few cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts , who were O@@ K and had healthy children after long flights .
&quot; What &apos;s more , it is dangerous even for or@@ bi@@ tal flights , &quot; adds pilot and cos@@ mon@@ aut , H@@ ero of the US@@ S@@ R , H@@ ero of Russia , Val@@ ery Po@@ lia@@ k@@ ov .
And yet , humanity needs to seek out some new aven@@ ues in bio@@ technologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial gravity .
Hy@@ dro@@ -@@ labor@@ atory of C@@ P@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight .
Here , cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zer@@ o-@@ gravity conditions .
Water imi@@ ta@@ tes wei@@ ght@@ lessness .
If for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , for inf@@ ants it is a native element .
Sm@@ all am@@ phi@@ bi@@ ans seem to confirm that life came to land from the o@@ cean .
There is a connection with the fact that an inf@@ ant spen@@ ds about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ o@@ tic flu@@ id in the wom@@ b ; it is easier to get used to water after that .
In principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing .
&quot; This is very little time to forget something , &quot; says inf@@ ant sw@@ im@@ ming instruc@@ tor Mar@@ ina A@@ k@@ sen@@ o@@ va .
In other words , if for a new@@ born wei@@ ght@@ lessness is more natural , a woman needs gravity , earth &apos;s pull .
S@@ tom@@ ach and pel@@ vic mus@@ cles usually quickly de@@ generate in wei@@ ght@@ lessness ; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced .
Well , let &apos;s assume that child@@ birth stimu@@ lators will work out .
Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room .
&quot; Then what ? &quot; - asks Val@@ ery Po@@ lia@@ k@@ ov about this non-@@ tri@@ vial issue .
On the other hand , a baby also needs artificial gravity .
When a body does not feel the earth &apos;s pull , it does not form the s@@ ke@@ le@@ tal and mus@@ cular system .
It is not possible to dres@@ s a new@@ born in or@@ bit into a special loading suit for training , as they do with adults .
He will simply not have what he needs to survive .
&quot; And this experiment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a handic@@ apped , completely un@@ adapted human to earth , &quot; predic@@ ts Chairman of the Committee on Bio@@ ethics IM@@ BP R@@ AN I@@ g@@ or Pes@@ to@@ v .
For the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory .
However , with time , it will become reality , when earth@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their off@@ spring , who were born in space .
N@@ K@@ U Head : S@@ var@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians .
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it la@@ gs behind in their application .
This was said by Mil@@ os@@ la@@ v K@@ ala , vice-@@ president of the Supreme Au@@ dit Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an interview for A@@ k@@ tu@@ al@@ ne@@ .@@ c@@ z@@ .
&quot; The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , &quot; states K@@ ala , commen@@ ting on the current situation .
Simi@@ lar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German audi@@ tors .
As an example of improper practice , they cite P@@ et@@ r Ne@@ cas &apos;s approach to the so-called &quot; S@@ var@@ c System . &quot;
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ DS will not be burden@@ ing business owners with its checks - so is it forbi@@ dden or allowed ?
&quot; The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohi@@ bits something , then even the Government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is du@@ ty-@@ bound to monitor and enforce , &quot; asser@@ ts K@@ ala .
At the audit committee &apos;s session in the House of Depu@@ ties , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared .
What exactly was this about ?
This is about parallel audi@@ ting , which we began around two years ago .
S@@ imply put , this is about how European legislation govern@@ s the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legisla@@ tions and then the actual practice itself .
We brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even &quot; more conci@@ se and complete , &quot; however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany .
This confirms that creating more and more conci@@ se rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
What does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
This kind of joint audit could contribute to curta@@ iling these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact .
Econom@@ y means acqui@@ ring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profi@@ te@@ ering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided .
However , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be procu@@ red .
The system might become over@@ lo@@ aded with the amount of paper@@ work , and those , who wish to look for loopholes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts .
How does the audit system work in Germany ?
Is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or is it organised differently ?
As far as the office is concerned , the B@@ un@@ des@@ rech@@ n@@ un@@ g@@ sh@@ of functions like our N@@ K@@ U , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices operate similarly .
Pow@@ ers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organised feder@@ ally , so these courts of audi@@ tors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own .
The B@@ R@@ H can only audit federal money , known to us as state funds .
Public funds , which , for us , are administered by regional and municipal authorities , are audi@@ ted by the federal courts of audi@@ tors there .
When it comes to their legislation , is it more straightforward than ours ?
Overall , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect .
Is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ?
That is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such compar@@ isons .
It should be said that even in a country we perce@@ ive as exemplary , they encounter a whole range of problems .
If that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
Com@@ ing back to domestic legislation , what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ?
The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifes@@ ted itself in our audit work yet .
Since we carry out our audits ex-@@ post , a certain delay has to be taken into account .
As yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new &quot; fiscal failure risk dete@@ ction &quot; system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed .
A problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes &quot; too constrain@@ ed &quot; and will not be enforceable .
Under the previous rules , parties being audi@@ ted were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline .
Is it worth constrain@@ ing the law in this way , in that case ?
I do not think this is the way .
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not penalise those , who make a mistake on a technic@@ ality , which does not affect the final decision .
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy .
So how can we get out of this ?
Let &apos;s see where this dead@@ -end takes us .
The Prime Minister recently said the O@@ DS will not be burden@@ ing busines@@ smen with audits of the so-called &quot; S@@ var@@ c System &quot; - what does this mean ?
Is the S@@ var@@ c System prohibited or allowed ?
The Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohi@@ bits something , then even the Government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is du@@ ty-@@ bound to monitor and enforce .
He may say : &quot; Let us change this law and rela@@ x it , &quot; but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there .
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formali@@ ties which must be adhered to - which is the right way to ensure public ten@@ ders are protected .
On the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bi@@ dder with the best offer is excluded on a technic@@ ality .
The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
Ro@@ ads are ic@@ y in places , but mostly pass@@ able .
In several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are ic@@ y and s@@ now@@ y .
However , the majority of roads are pass@@ able , with extra care needed in places .
Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad region
In the Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad region , the roads have been us@@ able this morning , though in some places they were ic@@ y and s@@ now@@ y .
The temper@@ ature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day .
S@@ no@@ wing in the region has stopped , and only a th@@ in la@@ yer of s@@ now remains in the low@@ lands .
However , the ri@@ dges of the K@@ rus@@ ne M@@ oun@@ tains have around 30 cen@@ ti@@ metres of s@@ now .
In some locations there is limited visibility due to mist , according to the local high@@ way service .
The R@@ 6 high-speed motor@@ way and primary roads in the region are now us@@ able without restriction .
Cau@@ tion is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be ic@@ y and sli@@ p@@ per@@ y .
All secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are also pass@@ able , including mountain roads .
In certain stre@@ t@@ ches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and comp@@ acted s@@ now pat@@ ches .
Above all , at higher levels , extra care should be taken while driving .
Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice and H@@ ra@@ de@@ c K@@ r@@ alo@@ ve region
On some roads in Eastern Bo@@ hem@@ ia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher al@@ titudes and in the mountains there might be a la@@ yer of comp@@ acted s@@ now , according to the Road and M@@ otor@@ way Director@@ ate .
The high@@ way service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher al@@ titudes of the Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice region in particular .
Black ice may occur around Lan@@ sk@@ ro@@ un , U@@ st@@ i na@@ d Or@@ lic@@ i , Po@@ lic@@ ky , S@@ vita@@ v@@ y , and V@@ y@@ so@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads .
The I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vita@@ v@@ y .
S@@ now is particularly affecting the roads in the K@@ r@@ k@@ on@@ ose and Or@@ lic@@ ke mountains .
At higher al@@ titudes , there is a comp@@ acted s@@ now la@@ yer on the roads around R@@ y@@ ch@@ no@@ v na@@ d K@@ ne@@ z@@ no@@ u and T@@ ru@@ t@@ no@@ v .
In Eastern Bo@@ hem@@ ia the day will be mostly clear to partly clou@@ dy , and dry .
Tem@@ per@@ a@@ tures will be between min@@ us three and plus one degree Cel@@ si@@ us mostly , with a light wind .
P@@ il@@ sen region
The roads in the P@@ il@@ sen region have been us@@ able this morning , with extra care needed in some places . D@@ rivers should take the weather conditions into account .
The morning will be fro@@ s@@ ty , with tempera@@ tures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero .
Due to the existing s@@ now and subsequent drop in temper@@ ature , certain roads may be ic@@ y .
D@@ rivers should expect mist in places , though visibility will gradually improve .
This information was reported by the region &apos;s high@@ way service .
The D@@ 5 motor@@ way is dri@@ vable almost without restriction , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 8@@ 0@@ th and 13@@ 1@@ st kilome@@ tre marks .
Most primary road sur@@ faces are dry and fro@@ st-@@ free .
Southern areas of the P@@ il@@ sen and T@@ ac@@ ho@@ v regions may have ic@@ y pat@@ ches .
Secon@@ dary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are w@@ et , and may therefore also have ic@@ y pat@@ ches .
D@@ rivers should be cautious especially on less frequ@@ en@@ ted roads in the Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ an Forest .
O@@ l@@ om@@ ou@@ c region
D@@ rivers should expect s@@ now slu@@ sh on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the O@@ l@@ om@@ ou@@ c region .
It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ ven@@ o@@ hor@@ k@@ se se@@ d@@ lo and on the way to V@@ ide@@ l@@ sky K@@ ri@@ z .
S@@ now@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were brought out by falling s@@ now overnight , the Su@@ m@@ per@@ k region , according to high@@ way maintenance , got around three cen@@ ti@@ metres of s@@ now .
In other parts of the region , roads are mainly pass@@ able without restrictions .
&quot; In the Su@@ m@@ per@@ k region , tr@@ aces of s@@ now have remained at the highest al@@ titudes .
D@@ rivers should expect s@@ now slu@@ sh at Cer@@ ven@@ o@@ hor@@ s@@ ke se@@ d@@ lo in the direction of J@@ esen@@ i@@ k , &quot; the dis@@ pa@@ tch officer for the Su@@ m@@ per@@ k high@@ way service told C@@ T@@ K today .
Their J@@ esen@@ i@@ k counterparts also made an ou@@ ting overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest al@@ titudes are now clear and w@@ et following the chemical treatment , according to them .
The O@@ l@@ om@@ ou@@ c region &apos;s roads are us@@ able without restriction , while in the area of S@@ tern@@ ber@@ k drivers should be@@ ware in wo@@ o@@ ded areas , where roads have remained w@@ et .
U@@ st@@ i na@@ d Lab@@ em region , Li@@ be@@ re@@ c region
Since this morning , the s@@ now@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern Bo@@ hem@@ ia .
Besides certain s@@ now@@ -@@ covered places , or some ic@@ y fro@@ st pat@@ ches , the mountain road from T@@ el@@ nice to K@@ n@@ in@@ ice in the U@@ st@@ i na@@ d Lab@@ em region is also closed , according to the police database .
Tem@@ per@@ a@@ tures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain s@@ now@@ y and ic@@ y . In the low@@ lands , however , particularly sou@@ the@@ ast of the Central Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ an U@@ plan@@ ds , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry .
No traffic hol@@ d-@@ ups have so far been reported .
I@@ cy fro@@ st pat@@ ches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Ste@@ ti .
According to me@@ te@@ oro@@ log@@ ists the conditions for this were perfect - ra@@ in and mel@@ ting s@@ now during the day , with a clear night and freezing tempera@@ tures .
Ad@@ verse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ st@@ i na@@ d Lab@@ em and Li@@ be@@ re@@ c regions .
The closure of the T@@ el@@ nice to K@@ n@@ in@@ ice road was caused by b@@ ent tre@@ e branches , which were weigh@@ ed down to road level by s@@ now@@ fall .
Sim@@ on Or@@ n@@ est : At the concer@@ ts we want a fusion of positive energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ?
It is just another star@@ t@@ ler , which we like to la@@ tch on to .
Together with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , we tend to jo@@ ke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or aver@@ t the end of the world completely .
In December you are even organising a unique series of three concer@@ ts against the end of the world .
Can you give our read@@ ers some details on this ?
This is a nation@@ wide fun@@ d-@@ raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years .
We decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the May@@ an calendar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.m.
On the eve , the 20@@ th of December , at 9@@ p@@ m , 3 concer@@ ts will take place in parallel in Prague , B@@ r@@ no , and O@@ str@@ ava .
They will end at around the time when Ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i Is@@ land in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the May@@ an calendar .
Who came up with this idea ?
Initi@@ ally it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our design@@ er , Hon@@ za Au@@ gusta .
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
On the occasion of the end of the May@@ an calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , sho@@ es , t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts , bag@@ s , and original ke@@ ys against the end of the world , which can be purcha@@ sed at w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ e-@@ ta@@ p@@ .@@ c@@ z to support our cause .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , together with other artists , also recorded the so-called an@@ them against the end of the world , called &quot; The En@@ d of the World is cancelled . &quot;
It is already well received on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , will it figure at the fun@@ d-@@ raising concer@@ ts ?
Of course , for the grand finale , as long as the world does not end beforehand .
It will be s@@ ung by all the artists at all the three concer@@ ts at the same time .
The an@@ them will also be fea@@ tured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Tele@@ vision .
The words were written and the role of J@@ es@@ us in the vi@@ deo cli@@ p was played by Tom@@ as Han@@ ak , X@@ in@@ d@@ l X also s@@ ings in it ...
How did you end up working with them ?
We collabor@@ ate also with other person@@ alities of the Czech cultural scene , due to organising a lot of fun@@ d-@@ raising events and concer@@ ts ...
We try to really get them involved in these projects .
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us .
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to ?
E@@ qui@@ pping the whe@@ el@@ chair@@ -@@ accessible educational Stu@@ deo centre , which is already in its sixth year , in collaboration with the citizens association Ta@@ p from the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute for the disabled .
Tu@@ tors come in regularly to spend time with the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute &apos;s students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them .
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tu@@ tors , so we try to provide this for them in this way .
Within the construction project at the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project .
Every concert sees the appearance of several ban@@ ds and artists .
How do you select them ?
We have tried to compi@@ le a programme , which speaks for all ages , including children .
For example , in Prague , Chin@@ as@@ ki , Support L@@ es@@ biens , Il@@ lu@@ stra@@ to@@ sphere with D@@ an Bar@@ ta , The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p , M@@ arian Ban@@ go and J@@ ir@@ i Su@@ ch@@ y will appear .
Further details can be found at w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ k@@ p@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ c@@ z@@ .
Are you planning any more &quot; bom@@ bas@@ tic events &quot; in the future ?
In May , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good lin@@ e-@@ up with some interesting gu@@ ests .
Next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Ch@@ ic@@ ago .
Your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is nonetheless a band composed of handic@@ apped people .
How do you cope with these journeys in terms of logis@@ tics and organisation ?
It is not as scar@@ y as it might seem at first .
We have five members in electri@@ c whe@@ el@@ cha@@ irs , which must be transported in the lu@@ gg@@ age area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of lu@@ gg@@ age and instrument cases ...
Nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , CS@@ A and British Air@@ ways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised .
Even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went smoothly .
Thanks to these international tri@@ ps , you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues , public attitudes to disability and so on .
What have been your experiences so far ?
After Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its begin@@ nings .
Com@@ pared to Prague , Moscow is rather in@@ accessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electri@@ c whe@@ el@@ chair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own .
Obvi@@ ous things , such as giving whe@@ el@@ cha@@ irs priority in lif@@ ts , are not comm@@ on@@ place there .
Fortunately , citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
And on the other hand , where do we still la@@ g behind more advanced countries ?
There are a lot of things , which we still la@@ g behind on ...
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected .
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public , and they can use the to@@ i@@ lets , go to the mu@@ seu@@ m , or wherever ...
It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p we are a step ahead !
Public respect or accessibility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous ath@@ letes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
So far there are only exceptional cases , people who are strong@@ -@@ wil@@ led .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what prompted you in 1998 to form it ?
I began my job as a tu@@ tor at the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute , where I was surroun@@ ded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
Since I am a musi@@ cian myself - among others I play the sa@@ x@@ op@@ h@@ one - I started a music club with a colleague .
With time , as our moder@@ ator L@@ ad@@ ya An@@ g@@ elo@@ vic says , it has grown a little out of our control ( lau@@ gh ) .
Your popu@@ lar@@ ity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mistaken ?
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous sing@@ ers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band .
We realised that work , which goes on un@@ seen can be like it never existed .
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tu@@ tors , equipment and so on .
W@@ as it your goal to take The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p to such hei@@ ghts ?
From the outset , I felt there was potential to do things a little differently .
S@@ how business is filled with things , where one imi@@ ta@@ tes the other .
It is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in hesi@@ tantly and take a long time .
Things , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would dare to claim that Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is one of those things .
A person &apos;s first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a natural reaction ...
But that pity is simply wasted , because handic@@ apped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be pi@@ tied .
They are people , who can fully live life and blo@@ s@@ so@@ m , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
I say that when a person with a handicap succe@@ eds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are suggesting ?
If we want to achieve top class work , we must be un@@ compromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
I think this is to be expected .
Some people come to us with a roman@@ tic idea and their head in the clou@@ ds , and when they find out they have to go to re@@ hear@@ s@@ als twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concer@@ ts , their enthusiasm quickly dis@@ appears .
That is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band currently has twenty members .
How many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?
Only one , L@@ ad@@ ya An@@ g@@ elo@@ vic .
We are an open group , people come and people go , this is unavoidable .
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open .
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20@@ .@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9@@ p@@ m .
The ven@@ ues will be Pra@@ ha In@@ che@@ ba , B@@ r@@ no Fle@@ da , and O@@ str@@ ava P@@ ly@@ no@@ je@@ m with performances from 12 ban@@ ds and other musi@@ ci@@ ans from the Czech Republic .
All three cities will be joined by a te@@ lev@@ ised lin@@ k@@ -up at the evening &apos;s close for a united ren@@ dition of The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p &apos;s an@@ them &quot; The En@@ d of the World is cancelled &quot;
The concert &apos;s goal is to raise funds to equip the S@@ T@@ U@@ D@@ E@@ O multi-@@ functional whe@@ el-@@ chair accessible learning centre at the J@@ ed@@ lic@@ ka Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech crow@@ ns .
Ad@@ mission fe@@ e to the concert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K , children under 12 years of age go free , tic@@ kets on sale from Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ ati@@ cket .
Poland and the Cos@@ mos .
Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the twentieth member of the agency , being the second nation from the former Eastern B@@ lock ( after the Czech Republic , which became a fully fledged member of the ESA on the 12@@ th of November 2008 ) .
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects .
Of course , Poland &apos;s path to the space had begun much earlier .
Polish bo@@ ff@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding .
I look back , for instance , to the lecture of A S@@ tern@@ fel@@ d in War@@ saw &apos;s as@@ tron@@ om@@ y observ@@ atory , who , on the 6@@ th of December 19@@ 33 , presented ideas on his pione@@ ering work En@@ try into space .
The thoughts of the young engine@@ er ( born 19@@ 05 ) left his audi@@ ence cold , and years later S@@ tern@@ fel@@ d remembered that only D@@ r. Jan G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski had shown an interest in his work .
In 19@@ 34 , for his work En@@ try into space , S@@ tern@@ fel@@ d received the Robert Es@@ nau@@ l@@ t-@@ P@@ el@@ terie and An@@ dre Louis H@@ ir@@ sch prize in France .
The above mentioned D@@ r. Jan G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski ( 18@@ 99 - 19@@ 66 ) later became a strong promo@@ ter of as@@ tron@@ om@@ y and as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics .
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journ@@ als , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects .
G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski became a world-@@ known promo@@ ter of as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recognised when a cra@@ ter on the far side of the Mo@@ on was named after him .
In 19@@ 25 , Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to be fit@@ ted with a ro@@ cket engine .
Unfortunately , both the project &apos;s design@@ er , and the project &apos;s details , are unknown .
It is not even clear , whether the ro@@ cket was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down .
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time .
In 19@@ 33 the Polish arti@@ l@@ ler@@ y started their engagement in flying bombs .
The research was undertaken by the We@@ apons Techno@@ logy Di@@ vision in collaboration with Pro@@ f@@ . Mi@@ ec@@ z@@ ys@@ law W@@ ol@@ f@@ ke and Pro@@ f@@ . G@@ us@@ ta@@ w Mo@@ k@@ r@@ z@@ y@@ ck@@ i .
From the documents , it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests .
Of course , the advance of the German army interrup@@ ted the research .
In 19@@ 37 , the concept of a photo@@ electri@@ c hom@@ ing ro@@ cket designed by engine@@ er Ro@@ ho@@ z@@ in@@ ski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The R@@ oc@@ ket - air tor@@ pe@@ do and flying roc@@ ke@@ t-@@ bomb appeared , auth@@ ored by Le@@ li@@ w@@ y-@@ K@@ ry@@ w@@ ob@@ loc@@ ki .
Both projects were destined for military use of ro@@ cket engines .
Im@@ medi@@ ately prior to the War , all projects for military use of ro@@ cket technologies were over@@ seen by the Pro@@ visi@@ onal Scientific Ad@@ vis@@ ory Board ( T@@ ym@@ c@@ z@@ a@@ so@@ w@@ y K@@ om@@ ite@@ t Dor@@ ad@@ c@@ z@@ o-@@ N@@ au@@ k@@ ow@@ y ) that coordinated all the work .
The Board was appointed in 19@@ 37 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War .
Further work devoted to as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics appeared in the Polish Pres@@ s after the War thanks to the Polish A@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ sk@@ ie Tow@@ ar@@ z@@ ys@@ two A@@ str@@ on@@ aut@@ y@@ c@@ z@@ ne ) .
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the ma@@ gaz@@ ine Pro@@ ble@@ ms in 19@@ 54 , in which four in-depth articles are on the subject of as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics .
In one of these , by Pro@@ f@@ . Su@@ bo@@ tow@@ ic@@ z , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedi@@ cate itself to as@@ tron@@ au@@ tics .
At the time , there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that cos@@ mic research was an emerging sector .
From the beginning of 19@@ 56 , the Polish A@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ tics Company ( P@@ TA ) sought entry to the International A@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ tics Federation ( est . 1951 ) and by autumn the P@@ TA was already a full member .
In the following year , the P@@ TA &apos;s first chairman , Kaz@@ imi@@ er@@ z Z@@ aran@@ ki@@ e@@ w@@ ic@@ z ( 19@@ 02 - 19@@ 59 ) was appointed Depu@@ ty Chairman for the International A@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ tics Federation .
He served in this capacity until his death in 19@@ 59 .
From 19@@ 56 , the P@@ TA played a significant role in the successful development of me@@ te@@ oro@@ logical roc@@ kets R@@ M ( R@@ ak@@ i@@ eta Me@@ te@@ oro@@ log@@ ic@@ z@@ na ) , which became the first Polish ro@@ cket to enable scientific research .
The first R@@ M@@ -@@ 1 model was completed in 19@@ 57 and the first launch took place on the 10@@ th of October 19@@ 58 .
The ro@@ cket , with a ceiling of 18@@ 00 metres , measured around 80 c@@ m in length and weigh@@ ed a little under 5 kg .
L@@ ater , the improved R@@ M@@ -@@ 1@@ A version was constructed and in the summer of 19@@ 59 launch tests were initiated for the two-@@ stage R@@ M@@ -@@ 2 ro@@ cket in the B@@ le@@ dow@@ sky Des@@ ert .
The ro@@ cket was 1.@@ 4 metres in length and weigh@@ ed approximately 11.@@ 5 kg .
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the R@@ M@@ -@@ 34 ro@@ cket was to reach 14@@ .5 km and be tas@@ ked with monitoring high al@@ titude win@@ ds .
Of course , in 19@@ 62 further research was stopped .
The successor to the R@@ M ro@@ cket type was the Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1 ro@@ cket , developed from 19@@ 62 to 19@@ 65 .
The ro@@ cket was designed as a two-@@ stage ro@@ cket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 c@@ m and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.5 kg .
Three models were developed ( designated Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which diff@@ ered in the room available for scientific appara@@ tus .
In the Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ A ro@@ cket , a space of 0.@@ 4 li@@ tres was available , Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ B had 0.@@ 34 li@@ tres , and Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ C had 0.@@ 62 li@@ tres .
The maximum al@@ titude for all three models was 3@@ 7@@ km .
Be@@ tween 19@@ 65 and 19@@ 68 , the development of Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 2 was underway in the A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 .
The Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 2 ro@@ cket had a launch weight of 3@@ 80 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a he@@ ight of around 6@@ 0@@ km .
Sub@@ se@@ quently built models were the Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 2@@ H and Me@@ te@@ or@@ -@@ 3 .
Poland &apos;s admission to CO@@ S@@ PA@@ R ( Committee for Space Research ) in 19@@ 60 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ S@@ PA@@ R board two years later .
Poland also participated in the Inter@@ k@@ os@@ mos space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites , and in 197@@ 8 , the Polish pilot Mi@@ ro@@ s@@ law Her@@ mas@@ ze@@ w@@ ski became the second inter@@ cos@@ mon@@ aut after Vla@@ di@@ mir R@@ em@@ k@@ ov .
Abo@@ li@@ shing the legislation on public works is not the solution .
Last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works .
The resolution caused lively public debate .
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective .
Liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU , just as those in the globalised world , are based on the principle of an un@@ regulated economic competition .
Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
The cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely un@@ regulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation .
Due to significant labour cost differences ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices .
On this basis , it should be understood that when a suppli@@ er tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods , &quot; the ru@@ g is pul@@ led &quot; from under the competition &apos;s prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
On a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import cheap@@ ly from abroad , or close down . The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies .
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
The whole situation is bol@@ ste@@ red by the busines@@ sman &apos;s complete un@@ willingness to pay taxes , which would alleviate the econom@@ ical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data .
The ru@@ th@@ less private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
In other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while dis@@ regarding the drop in social standards .
This occurs chiefly in amendments to existing law .
The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dicta@@ ted by private capital , especially in terms of salaries .
On one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long-term unemployment , on the other , restricted employee rights in the workplace .
This yiel@@ ds growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich .
In Germany there are already a host of food han@@ d-@@ out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
The number of these people is already in the millions .
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy , it comm@@ only occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of auxi@@ li@@ ary staff in the B@@ un@@ desta@@ g .
The auster@@ ity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pres@@ sured by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emigra@@ te as it was in the 19@@ th century , or to e@@ ke out an existence on star@@ v@@ ation wages on the edge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment .
At this point we have to ask where this may come from ?
If it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shif@@ ted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Braz@@ i@@ li@@ an , Turkish , Moroccan , Egyptian , and African labour is still at a fra@@ ction of European wages .
This applies to all of Latin America .
Liberal theory and the Media in@@ cess@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin .
Pri@@ v@@ ate capital cruel@@ ly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy .
The@@ re@@ upon , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own sel@@ fish ends .
Here , the answer must be yes .
The proof is the existence of the almost omni@@ po@@ tent , and in all states , omni@@ present lobby .
The result is a desperate situation manifes@@ ting itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is punishable .
In Germany the situation is such that state minis@@ tries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry .
These laws are then approved in the B@@ un@@ desta@@ g .
Re@@ al power does not come from the people as the W@@ ester@@ n-@@ style constitutions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests .
It is clear that liber@@ ally-@@ orienta@@ ted democracies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by Ap@@ pi@@ an in his work on the Rom@@ an Republic Cri@@ sis in the time of C@@ es@@ ar and Pom@@ pe@@ i : &quot; The State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offices taken by force .
With bri@@ ber@@ y , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with stones or s@@ words .
Bri@@ ber@@ y and corruption were ri@@ fe and un@@ hindered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought &quot; ... &quot; people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole deb@@ ac@@ le meant the state went eight months without consul@@ s .. &quot; .. &quot; There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ cra@@ cy , and an energe@@ tic man should be elected . &quot; Ap@@ pi@@ an had Pom@@ pe@@ i in mind , but it was C@@ es@@ ar who changed democracy for auto@@ cra@@ cy permanently .
The conclusion , just as in anti@@ qu@@ ity , the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole .
Pri@@ v@@ ate capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
The outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented decad@@ ence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
The caus@@ ality of the rise of the fasci@@ st and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the mis@@ guided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19@@ th and 20@@ th centuries .
The current state of affairs , when we consider the de@@ mise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an inter@@ lu@@ de , can expect its next cycle .
The particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already witnessing , as well as crimes against humanity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
The abolition of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term .
Under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population &apos;s living standards .
This pattern is thus syste@@ mic .
To address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state &apos;s capital participation in the economy , increase the people &apos;s influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
Israel : Cha@@ os La@@ b .
&quot; Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could , &quot; from S@@ ting &apos;s Fra@@ gi@@ le , where one of the main ver@@ ses from the refrain is &quot; L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . &quot;
&quot; If my sons did not want war , there would be none , &quot; said the dying Gu@@ tle Sch@@ n@@ ap@@ per , wife of Mayer Am@@ s@@ ch@@ el Roth@@ s@@ child in 18@@ 49 .
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza stri@@ p , as always , has spar@@ ked a lot of reaction .
Some stand by Israel , arguing it has the right to self-@@ defence , and Palestinians are por@@ tra@@ yed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claiming racism by the Israeli state , claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Ara@@ bs , and that Israel is a terrorist state .
I do not want to dwell , in these repeated perio@@ dic waves of killing , on who is the trans@@ gres@@ sor and who is the victim , after all , today &apos;s inhabitants of Israel , including the self-@@ governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence .
I would like to offer the read@@ ers a pe@@ ek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 9@@ 5-@@ year long tension is serving ( starting from Bal@@ four &apos;s declaration in November 19@@ 17 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East .
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
Human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power .
In every era we can find an Alexan@@ der the Great or a Napole@@ on .
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently , or whether behind their th@@ r@@ one stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-@@ calculated goal .
We must accept that we live in a time when the world &apos;s wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it ex@@ u@@ des could not happen in one generation &apos;s lif@@ esp@@ an .
Among these as@@ tron@@ om@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the pup@@ pet master ( whether someone else stands above them , I am un@@ sure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ s@@ chil@@ ds .
Not much is written about them .
Under@@ stand@@ ably .
The first news agency ( Re@@ u@@ ters ) they bought in the 90 &apos;s of the 19@@ th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high crimin@@ ality , which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both .
They hold majority sta@@ kes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either w@@ aging or preparing for war ( before the assau@@ lt on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the over@@ throw of K@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) .
W@@ ho@@ ever attempted to de@@ fy this family died .
A@@ bra@@ ham Lin@@ col@@ n refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Roth@@ s@@ child Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state-@@ issued ) money and was assassin@@ ated in 18@@ 65 at the the@@ a@@ tre .
J@@ F@@ K began issuing his own money and wanted to close the F@@ ed ( Federal Res@@ er@@ ve ) , and was killed in 19@@ 63 , Con@@ gres@@ sman Louis Mc@@ F@@ ad@@ den was pois@@ oned in 19@@ 36 , after he had intended to su@@ e the F@@ ed for causing the Great De@@ pression of 19@@ 29 .
Their thir@@ st for global power led in the years of 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to the formulation of a three-@@ world-@@ war plan by the free@@ ma@@ son leader of the 3@@ 3@@ r@@ d degree , Al@@ bert Pi@@ ke .
The first war was to remove the large mon@@ archi@@ c state bodies in Europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world &apos;s population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of sla@@ ves will suffice for their com@@ fort and lux@@ ury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( ecu@@ men@@ ism is just an appe@@ tiser for this solution ) , and finally the sei@@ zing of absolute power .
The method , which the group of wealthy families with the Roth@@ s@@ chil@@ ds leading the way , employ is the instig@@ ation of crises , followed by the offering of a solution ( order a@@ b cha@@ o - order from chaos ) .
These solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vide establishment of the F@@ ed , so that the crisis of 19@@ 07 would not be repeated ) .
Thus , having succeeded in assassin@@ ating Fer@@ din@@ and , the Hab@@ s@@ burg he@@ ir to the Aus@@ tro@@ -@@ Hungarian th@@ r@@ one , in Sar@@ aj@@ evo thereby un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing World War I , they destroyed t@@ s@@ ar@@ ist Russia with the B@@ ol@@ sh@@ evi@@ k revolution .
The First World War ended ab@@ rup@@ tly , militari@@ ly and economically un@@ substanti@@ ated , with German cap@@ itu@@ lation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy t@@ s@@ ar@@ ist Russia ) and the central European powers of Austri@@ a-@@ Hungary were subsequently disman@@ tled .
To facilitate the in@@ ception of the Second World War , they allowed ban@@ kers and politicians to create a la@@ tent conflict situation by sad@@ d@@ ling Germany with huge war repar@@ ations , thereby making a radic@@ alist example of the impover@@ ished mas@@ ses , it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing cul@@ prit and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi-@@ racial Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth colon@@ y , once the war had been igni@@ ted .
At the end of the 19@@ th Cen@@ tury , the Roth@@ s@@ chil@@ ds instig@@ ated the establishment of the Z@@ ion@@ ist movement , one bran@@ ch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ de@@ a , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Re@@ turn to Z@@ ion ) .
The aforementioned Bal@@ four Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population .
Terroris@@ t attacks occurred on both sides .
World War II broke out , and whether Hitler broke free from the leas@@ h , which international ban@@ kers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world &apos;s acceptance of the Jewish State .
Israel was officially formed in 19@@ 48 , and just as the war repar@@ ations for World War II were la@@ yed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war &apos;s hot@@ bed .
Pro@@ vi@@ ded the international ban@@ kers succeed , the Jewish N@@ ation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the Ara@@ bic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East .
Israel is like a huge labor@@ atory , a source of discor@@ d and chaos not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Who is the wron@@ g-@@ do@@ er and who is the victim in the Palesti@@ ne@@ -@@ Israel conflict , where injustice bre@@ eds injustice in an endless cycle of violence , while everything began from the gre@@ ed of a few and their lu@@ st for global power ?
Here , we must differenti@@ ate between Israel &apos;s general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international ban@@ kers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
Israel &apos;s current prime minister , Ne@@ tan@@ y@@ ah@@ u &apos; the ha@@ w@@ k &apos; , is a typical example of a fasci@@ st politician , loyal to the international ban@@ kers , who does everything to instig@@ ate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the S@@ han@@ g@@ hai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the H@@ or@@ mu@@ z S@@ trait , where 20 % of the world &apos;s oil must s@@ ail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world &apos;s economy .
In what light stand the words , spoken by David R@@ oc@@ k@@ ef@@ el@@ ler in 1994 : &quot; All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Or@@ der . &quot;
The New World Or@@ der in their eyes is one of master and sla@@ ve .
A world where the rest of the human population serve the lux@@ ury of a hand@@ ful of financial aris@@ to@@ cra@@ ts .
A world , where each new@@ -@@ born is implan@@ ted with a chi@@ p , which makes their existence completely sub@@ jug@@ ated .
&quot; He also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and sla@@ ve , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his name .
If anyone has insight , let him calcu@@ late the number of the be@@ ast ,
for it is man &apos;s number . His number is six hundred and six@@ ty six . &quot;
Ar@@ go : When things are at their worst - call Hol@@ ly@@ wood .
In November 1979 , a mo@@ b of Islamic student demonstrators took over the American emb@@ ass@@ y in Te@@ h@@ ran and held 52 diplomats hostage .
They were to be released in exchange for the over@@ thrown Sha@@ h Mo@@ ham@@ mad Re@@ za Pa@@ h@@ lav@@ i , who f@@ led after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades .
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Sha@@ h over@@ board , because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other alli@@ ed countries .
The release of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the the@@ ocra@@ tic regime , could not be achieved .
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States , which was later compoun@@ ded by the fi@@ asco of attempting to free the hostages by force .
The incar@@ cer@@ ated diplomats were finally released after 4@@ 44 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Algerian government .
Their or@@ deal provo@@ ked a wave of solidarity and anti-@@ Iranian feelings at home .
The deb@@ ac@@ le in Iran significantly influenced J@@ im@@ my Car@@ ter &apos;s loss with R@@ on@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an in the 1980 presidential elections .
The film Ar@@ go , directed by the actor Ben Aff@@ lec@@ k , re@@ counts one episo@@ de in this story , which brought America a small victory .
Just before the emb@@ ass@@ y was seized , six employees esca@@ ped .
After some peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , they ended up in the Canadian ambass@@ ador &apos;s residence .
The CI@@ A , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew , who were surve@@ ying locations for a sci@@ -@@ f@@ i block@@ bus@@ ter .
A combination of gen@@ res
The plan , conceived by &quot; ex@@ fil@@ tration &quot; expert , Tony Men@@ dez , required the assistance of Hol@@ ly@@ wood .
For the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist ma@@ gaz@@ ines , press conferences were organised , and the fic@@ ti@@ tious production company had a real office .
The details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film draws on the mem@@ ories of Tony Men@@ dez .
Aff@@ lec@@ k &apos;s film is a peculiar mix of gen@@ res .
On one hand , there is a realistic inci@@ sive political thri@@ ller , and at the same time a &quot; cap@@ er mo@@ vie , &quot; with small vic@@ tories and dou@@ ble-@@ crossing - another example would be O@@ cean &apos;s E@@ lev@@ en .
The mo@@ od alter@@ na@@ tes in the film - on one side , sharp docu@@ men@@ tary-@@ style se@@ qu@@ ences in Te@@ h@@ ran ( the title se@@ quence shows i@@ con@@ ic pho@@ tos from news of the time , relating to the same events por@@ tra@@ yed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
On the other hand , li@@ ghter sections from Hol@@ ly@@ wood , lac@@ ed with iron@@ y and a little exagger@@ ation .
Then there are scenes from the CI@@ A headquarters and other agencies - men in su@@ its debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corridors , over the phone ...
Ben Aff@@ lec@@ k has managed to res@@ tar@@ t his career in extraordinary style .
The deri@@ ded actor has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of iron@@ ic comments .
Ar@@ go is his third bi@@ g-@@ s@@ creen mo@@ vie , following his dark crime mo@@ vie G@@ one B@@ ab@@ y G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the thri@@ ller The T@@ own ( 2010 ) .
It is also Aff@@ lec@@ k &apos;s first picture , which does not take place in the director &apos;s home@@ town of Bo@@ st@@ on .
The atmos@@ ph@@ eric feel in different locations is one of the characteristics , which took his earlier films above Hol@@ ly@@ wood standards .
Aff@@ lec@@ k shows it in Ar@@ go , where Te@@ h@@ ran is &quot; fea@@ tured &quot; by Canada .
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening se@@ quence of the sie@@ ge on the emb@@ ass@@ y is impres@@ sively luci@@ d , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come floo@@ ding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
A similar effect is achieved by Aff@@ lec@@ k and his team in the fic@@ ti@@ tious scenes ( the fa@@ ke staff at the Te@@ h@@ ran ba@@ z@@ a@@ ar ) .
Too much action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many na@@ il-@@ bi@@ ting scenes for the film .
What little there is , is worked well , with some occa@@ sional emb@@ el@@ li@@ sh@@ ments to reality - these do not all come off so e@@ leg@@ antly ( the scene , where a lo@@ om@@ ing crisis is aver@@ ted at Te@@ h@@ ran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a cha@@ se on the run@@ way seems quite far-@@ fe@@ tched ) .
Ar@@ go &apos;s weakness is its divergence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places .
A@@ lan Ar@@ kin and John Go@@ od@@ man play their roles as the Hol@@ ly@@ wood assistants with great char@@ m ; their charac@@ ters deserve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film .
Aff@@ lec@@ k &apos;s film lo@@ ses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be wat@@ ched with reasonable interest , its production and retro@@ -@@ style are e@@ voc@@ ative of thri@@ ll@@ ers from the 70 &apos;s .
It does not really cap@@ tiv@@ ate .
As a reminder of history &apos;s particular ways and a testi@@ mony to how exagger@@ ated the views are on the all-@@ powerful all-@@ controlling secret services , this will do .
Rules for b@@ lowing up bal@@ lo@@ ons , for bananas and a circu@@ s
The w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ bank@@ ov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .@@ com server , which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announce a competition for &quot; the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . &quot;
&quot; We were prompted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe &apos;s largest companies , &quot; Patri@@ k N@@ ach@@ er , the poll &apos;s organiser , told Pra@@ vo .
Among the latest nomin@@ ated absur@@ di@@ ties , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to uni@@ fy insurance premiums for men and women .
Until now , women were favoured in life insurance prices , because they constitute a lower risk for insu@@ rers .
&quot; Other un@@ believ@@ able ideas from the EU can be nomin@@ ated by anyone until the end of the year .
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013 , &quot; informed N@@ ach@@ er .
Among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of bio-@@ ingredients to fuel , which consequently har@@ ms the environment , the ban on reliable mer@@ cur@@ y ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ters just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chicken c@@ ages , which significantly raised eg@@ g prices this year .
The ban on the use of the term &quot; spre@@ ad@@ able butter &quot; and the withdrawal of classi@@ c light bul@@ bs from sale had previously come under criticism .
First rate bananas are to measure 14 cen@@ ti@@ metres
The Union &apos;s machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states &apos; interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being ve@@ to@@ ed ) .
The lobby &apos;s interests were , for example , that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 c@@ m in the EU , and were not to display and &quot; anomal@@ ous cur@@ va@@ ture . &quot;
The European Commission defended itself , saying that it was only harmonising existing dis@@ join@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading .
Nor@@ ms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been sof@@ tened by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives .
One possible pri@@ z@@ e-@@ winner in the poll may be the last year &apos;s EU regulation according to which infla@@ table bal@@ lo@@ ons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inf@@ late them without parental supervision .
Here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , bal@@ lo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child suff@@ oc@@ ation .
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blow@@ ers .
S@@ tran@@ ge ideas are conceived at home too
F@@ air@@ ly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece , and instead the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m FYROM ( Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) should be used .
The Ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .@@ com server in collaboration with the Liberal Econom@@ ist Association , La@@ issez F@@ aire , also nomin@@ ated , aside from the aforementioned absur@@ di@@ ties , for example the Union &apos;s regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state .
The EU stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
The Czech Republic there@@ after exceeded , for instance , the permitted volume of m@@ ush@@ room preser@@ ves , which incurred a high penalty .
The poll &apos;s organis@@ ers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding .
These ideas did not come from Brussels , however , but from Prague .
&quot; We are handic@@ apped because we do not have the sea .
We are asking the European Union for a re@@ fund , &quot; declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , Jar@@ os@@ la@@ v Pal@@ as ( CS@@ S@@ D ) .
His argument was that there had been a good har@@ v@@ est of cereals , and due to the so-called bu@@ y-@@ out interventions , the state &apos;s wa@@ re@@ houses were full and were forced to export .
The Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euro@@ s .
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea .
Fun@@ ding to subsidise funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development &apos;s minister , P@@ av@@ el N@@ eme@@ c ( US@@ -@@ D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .
EU : Bi@@ zar@@ re legislation is the exception
Regulations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU &apos;s efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts .
A more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting .
E@@ motions fl@@ are among Cze@@ ch@@ s when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
The Cze@@ ch@@ s fought for six years with the Germans and Austri@@ ans to protect the labelling of their O@@ l@@ om@@ ou@@ cke t@@ var@@ u@@ z@@ ky , however the tu@@ z@@ em@@ sky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19@@ th century here , had to be ren@@ am@@ ed tu@@ ze@@ ma@@ k by the manufacturers .
The appel@@ lation of rum can only be given to products dis@@ ti@@ lled from can@@ e sugar , and not sugar be@@ et .
Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad wa@@ fers , Po@@ ho@@ re@@ lic@@ ky and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p , and Z@@ ate@@ c hop@@ s have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world-@@ ren@@ owned fe@@ ta che@@ ese and gor@@ gon@@ zo@@ la , German mar@@ zi@@ p@@ an from Lu@@ be@@ ck , and Par@@ ma ham .
The EU &apos;s stamp of protection can also be pro@@ u@@ dly shown on Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice g@@ ing@@ er@@ bre@@ ad and H@@ or@@ ic@@ ky tu@@ bes .
People want me to save the re@@ public , but I am an ama@@ teur , says O@@ k@@ am@@ ura
Sen@@ ator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ?
This is not about me being a sen@@ ator or president .
If everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post .
I cannot watch any longer the country having been rob@@ bed over the past twenty years , thi@@ eves ro@@ am@@ ing about there and people &apos;s taxes and retirement age increasing .
I had no ambition to be a politician .
When I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things .
Since I have already turned forty , and I am an independent non-@@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for sen@@ ator or president .
You have already reached the Sen@@ ate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Cas@@ tle .
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Cas@@ tle based on the results in the Sen@@ ate &apos;s elections .
L@@ ater , I added that if I were elected as sen@@ ator , I would be standing for president .
My goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised .
Therefore , I need the greatest influence , and the strongest mandate possible .
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pu@@ b or at the television , but that we tram@@ ple anyone , who wants to try to change things .
The Media add to this , misleading the public , and mis@@ taking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
For example , I was allegedly bri@@ bing repor@@ ters , or I was allegedly an advis@@ or of J@@ ir@@ i Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k .
Let &apos;s talk about your vision .
You set out on your cas@@ tle sie@@ ge with a thesis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics , and a retro@@ active financial disclosure of assets over twenty million .
You need to change the law for this .
As president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Sen@@ ate as a whole may propose laws .
How are you going to solve this ?
When I lob@@ bi@@ ed , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
The problem is political squ@@ ab@@ b@@ ling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public .
As an independent non-@@ party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
The advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ ge@@ on@@ ho@@ ling or dog@@ mas I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
Do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ?
From the Czech viewpoint , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
For me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right .
The important part for me is moving forward .
It is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ S@@ C@@ M or the O@@ DS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas .
You get an@@ gry when someone calls you a popu@@ list .
Are you not confirming this with what you have stated ?
When you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision .
You try to come close to it .
Some may call it popu@@ lism , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slog@@ ans .
You will not last long in politics with that .
Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
I have no alternative .
I need to convince politicians , repor@@ ters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
If I were elected president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil servants , judges , and the At@@ tor@@ ney General .
And , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this .
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
Take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure .
I will say frankly that I am an ama@@ teur , I am not a geni@@ us or an intellectual .
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision .
I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda .
I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
It sounds a little like O@@ k@@ am@@ ura is trying to save the Czech Republic .
I am no sa@@ viour .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces , whether they would run for the sen@@ ate .
I went to Radi@@ m J@@ an@@ cura , who decl@@ ined due to his work@@ load .
So I , at least , support investig@@ ative journalist , J@@ ana Lor@@ en@@ co@@ va , who un@@ covered fraudu@@ lent activity with light he@@ ating oil .
I put myself forward , because people are really dis@@ conten@@ ted , but now I have my doubts .
Si@@ x@@ ty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment .
In the sen@@ ate , there are only two indepen@@ dents , including me .
People have voted for a sen@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes .
Nonetheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of may@@ ors or regional council presidents .
Are you considering having your own party ?
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand .
You have no money ?
You are talking about financial dis@@ closures , but what is yours like ?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million .
In Prague , I have land worth around 25 million , an a@@ part@@ ment worth ten million , another a@@ part@@ ment worth eight million , an ar@@ t@@ work collection worth around ten million , an A@@ st@@ on Martin worth 3.@@ 5 million , a S@@ ko@@ da Super@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account .
I have the A@@ st@@ on Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a bo@@ y - I always liked James B@@ ond , who dro@@ ve the car , was g@@ allant with women and also fought against evil and villa@@ in@@ y .
You drive an A@@ st@@ on Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ?
You say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
This does not inspire much confidence .
I do not have 15 million for a campaign .
Should I take out a loan ?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign .
The fact that I do not have any spon@@ sors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme .
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a sen@@ ator .
However , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son &apos;s English school , which costs 30 thousand a month .
If I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election .
So you will still be in business so that you can make a living ?
Di@@ d you not say you would be putting this on hold ?
This depends on the rate of pay .
As I promised , my activities have been partially reduced .
For example , my depu@@ ty is taking over as the CE@@ O of the travel agency in spring .
People would like me to be a S@@ am@@ ari@@ tan , who sav@@ es the Republic .
But I must also live off something .
As a busines@@ sman , what would you usually make monthly ?
Two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do .
And if I became president , then I would end my business activity .
The full interview can be read in Saturday &apos;s issue of Pra@@ vo .
