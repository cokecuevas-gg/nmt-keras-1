Spectacular Wingsuit Jump Over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter above Bogota , the capital of Colombia , on Thursday .
Wearing a wingsuit , he flew past over the famous Monserrate Sanctuary at 160km / h . The sanctuary is located at an altitude of over 3000 meters and numerous spectators had gathered there to watch his exploit .
A black box in your car ?
As America &apos;s road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car .
The devices , which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats , are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America &apos;s major roads .
The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances .
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
The tea party is aghast .
The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
And while Congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
They are exploring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes , some of which have GPS monitoring , for a test drive .
This really is a must for our nation .
&quot; It is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said Hasan Ikhrata , executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025 .
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do it .
The push comes as the country &apos;s Highway Trust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is broke .
Americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to .
Cars get many more miles to the gallon .
The federal tax itself , 18.4 cents per gallon , hasn &apos;t gone up in 20 years .
Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high .
&quot; The gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said Lee Munnich , a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota .
His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system .
&quot; This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee .
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals , as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example .
California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
But Rep. Bill Shuster ( R-Pa . ) , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .
The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile .
&quot; This is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Adrian Moore , vice president of policy at Reason .
People are paying more directly into what they are getting .
The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction .
The U.S. Senate approved a $ 90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars .
But the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
The most eager is Oregon , which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .
Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
Nevada has already completed a pilot .
New York City is looking into one .
Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks .
And the I-95 Coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In Nevada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
&quot; Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem , &quot; said Alauddin Khan , who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation .
It was not something people wanted .
As the trial got underway , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website : &quot; It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices . &quot;
There is no need to build an enormous , unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and goings .
Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
If you can do that , Khan said , the public gets more comfortable .
The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage .
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mileage .
But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , uploaded periodically by modem .
&quot; People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said Ryan Morrison , chief executive of True Mileage .
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .
There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this .
In Oregon , planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices .
They can choose a device with or without GPS .
Or they can choose not to have a device at all , opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more , not less .
In New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; pay-as-you-drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .
Some transportation planners , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction .
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes .
An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin , &quot; said Randy Rentschler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .
If we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .
David Bowie : Four Unpublished Songs Released
The British musician is full of surprises this year .
Following The Next Day , released in January , he has put together a deluxe re-release planned for November 04 , featuring several unpublished tracks .
Four have already appeared on the Internet .
The announcement that David Bowie was releasing a new album had stunned the world .
On 08 January 2013 , the date of his 66th birthday , he announced that a new album would be released in March .
After ten years of silence ( his last record , Reality , was released in 2003 ) and very few public appearances , the British musician proved that he could still light up the pop scene .
A feast for fans
Not tired of making surprises , David Bowie had more than one trick up his sleeves with The Next Day :
the Thin White Duke was also planning to re-release the album on November 04 .
He put together a real feast for his fans to mark the occasion .
This re-release , titled The Next Day Extra , was presented in the form of three disks : the original album , unpublished studio sessions and remixes , plus a DVD containing the four clips that have already been unveiled .
The Next Day Extra had a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album : the three songs from the Deluxe edition , five songs specially unveiled for the occasion , and two remixes .
Moreover , David Bowie has introduced this fine box-set through a video .
In it , he presents each of the disks plus the accessories provided with them : exclusive photos and sleeves , a notebook for sharing your own impressions , a booklet of lyrics etc .
And finally , he gives a teaser to his new track , Atomica , which is typically in the style of The Next Day , with very prominent guitars and skillfully controlled rock electrics .
Previously Unpublished Tracks Released
However , Atomica is not the only track to have been released .
The Informer , Like A Rocket Man and Born In A UFO are also available on the net .
The Informer is double-edged - an unsettling intro followed by a brilliant rush of sound that progressively slows down to make way for a pop ballad .
Was Bowie trying to make a reference to Elton John &apos;s Rocket Man , or even Gravity , in his Like A Rocket Man ?
Either way , with this cheerful track , the singer seems to be in his element when his feet are no longer on the ground .
Space Oddity , by comparison , was much more solemn .
On Born in a UFO , David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness : could he have come from another planet ?
The spellbinding guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth .
In any case , Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon in these tracks : in turn , an informer , a rocket man , possibly a Martian ...
He veils and reveals at the same time , and likes to take on different personalities , as he has throughout his career , most notably with his personas : Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane .
It is therefore not surprising that he should be holding a mask in the promotional photography for L &apos;Invitation au Voyage , by Louis Vuitton , of which he is the new face .
He appears in one of their adverts , broadcast from November 10 .
The Minister of Defence , Rob Nicholson , insisted that injured soldiers are not summarily discharged from the Canadian Armed Forces and stressed that all soldiers undergo a transition process before their return to civilian life .
Attacked by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons , Mr. Nicholson assured that , prior to their discharge , members of the army underwent a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors .
&quot; All injured soldiers receive the appropriate care in preparation for their return to civilian life and none has been discharged before being ready , &quot; he asserted .
