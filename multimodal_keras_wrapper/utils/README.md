# Multimodal Keras Wrapper utils

In this directory, you'll find some utilities for Models and Datasets from the MKW. 
The main scripts are the following:

* **average_models.py**: Performs model averaging for multiple models.
* **minimize_dataset.py**: Removing the data stored in a dataset instance. Keeps the rest of attributes of the dataset (types, ids, params, preprocessing...).
